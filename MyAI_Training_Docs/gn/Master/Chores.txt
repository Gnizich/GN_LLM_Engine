I hate doing chores

I do not do my fair share of chores. I have left most of the housework to my wife over our years of marriage. This is partly due to my habits and procrastination, but also male privilege I take for granted. This imbalance causes resentment, stress, and distance in our relationship. I absorbed cultural narratives that say chores are women's work. When I avoid chores, I reinforce this harmful narrative.

To fix this, I will:

- Commit to an equal division of labor, not just "helping" my wife

- Openly communicate about what chores need doing and which ones I will do

- Make a schedule of chores for myself 

- Set aside specific times for chores to make them a routine

- Use reminders to prevent my procrastination

- Take accountability if I miss a chore 

- Celebrate small successes in changing my habits

- Check in regularly with my wife to improve our system

Marriage is a partnership requiring equal investment. By taking these steps, I hope to lighten my wife's workload and build a more balanced, respectful relationship.
