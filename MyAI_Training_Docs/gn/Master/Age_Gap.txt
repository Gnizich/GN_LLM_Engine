These are the frustrations I experience as a mature man working wih 20 and 30 somethings

Man, lemme tell you, working in tech at 62 is like being a classic rock song in a playlist full of EDM hits. You're not everyone's go-to, but you've got your own charm. I might not have grown up with smartphones glued to my hand, but I've got this whole "wise elder" vibe going, you know?

The joys are real. The young guns around me are just brimming with energy and fresh ideas. It's like being around a bunch of Teslas while I'm the trusty ol' pickup truck. And you bet that gives me a kind of exhilarating energy boost. Every time I see them tackle problems and come up with innovative solutions, it makes me feel like I'm a part of something groundbreaking, like I'm still "in the game" so to speak.

But oh boy, the frustrations? Cue the dramatic music. See, I'm a social animal, always have been. Give me a good joke, and I'll give you a belly laugh you won't forget. But despite my charming personality (if I do say so myself) and my best attempts at humor, I just can't seem to bridge that generational gap.

It's like they're speaking a different language sometimes. They talk in memes, GIFs, and references to shows that—no kidding—I've never heard of. And don't get me started on their social media lingo. "Hey, did you see that tweet from so-and-so? Totally went viral!" Uh, sure, but when I was your age, "going viral" was something you wanted to avoid.

What really stings is the after-work hangouts. They'll huddle up, making plans for drinks or some weekend escapade, and I'm just standing there like a decoration, usually left out of the invite. Ouch. I've tried to initiate outings myself, even learned how to create a "group chat," but the response is always lukewarm. I end up feeling like that kid in school who throws a party but nobody shows up. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not like they're outright ignoring me. We'll have short conversations, and they'll politely laugh at my jokes—especially the dad jokes, go figure—but it doesn't go beyond that. It's like we're on two different frequencies and can't quite tune into each other.

So what's a 62-year-old guy to do? I've considered going full-on "cool grandpa" mode: rocking some trendier outfits, maybe getting a hipster haircut. But who am I kidding? That's not me. Instead, I'm focusing on what I can bring to the table: experience, wisdom, and a killer playlist of classic rock songs.

I might not be in the "in-crowd," but I've got my own flavor of cool. And who knows, maybe one day these young whipper-snappers will realize that a little classic rock mixes pretty well with EDM. Until then, I'll keep strumming my own tune, enjoying the ride and dealing with the bumps in the road. After all, I've been around the block a few times; I know that every friendship, just like a good song, takes time to become a hit.
