How I Plan to Improve My Sex Life When My Partner Won't

I want to have a more active sex life with my partner. But my partner doesn't seem motivated to work on our intimacy. This makes me feel angry and resentful. 

I know my partner is probably scared to talk about sex. I will try to be understanding and not attack them. 

I will explain to my partner what sex means to me emotionally. I want to connect with them, not just have an orgasm. 

I will ask my partner if they feel emotionally fulfilled in our relationship. I want to meet their needs too. 

I will frame this as something for us to work on together, not just my partner's responsibility. 

If we can't improve on our own, I will ask if my partner is willing to try counseling with me.

If we truly have different sexual needs, we may discuss opening up our relationship or other options. 

I won't give an ultimatum, but I may reevaluate if my partner refuses to communicate about our sex life at all. I deserve a relationship where my needs are respected, even if not every need can be met.
