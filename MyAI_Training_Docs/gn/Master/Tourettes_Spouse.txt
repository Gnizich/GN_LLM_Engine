These are my wife Denise's feelings about me having tourettes syndrom as an adult

Oh, babe, watching you go through this Tourette's journey is like watching someone I love climb a mountain without a safety harness. Seriously, it's a mixed bag of emotions over here—sadness, frustration, and that pit-in-my-stomach feeling of helplessness. It's like watching a suspenseful movie where I'm just praying for a happy ending, you know?

Don't get me wrong, I know you're still the same incredible person I fell head over heels for. It's just that the "new normal" takes some getting used to, like suddenly discovering that my favorite book has a few extra chapters I never knew about. But hey, I'm in it for the long haul, quirks and all. 

The uncertainty can get to me sometimes. I worry about what this means for us, for our vibe. You and me, we're a team, and it feels like the game just got harder. But what's love if not sticking through the tough levels together, right?

I've also been chatting with friends and family, and yeah, even some pros. You'd be amazed how a good venting session or solid advice can be as comforting as your favorite pair of sweatpants. So we'll take this one day at a time, learning the ropes and tripping over them together. Because that's what we do, we conquer mountains—even if we have to make our own safety harness along the way.
