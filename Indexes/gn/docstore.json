Here\u2019s why\u2014and how.\nfitness over 60\nLooking for a fountain of youth? Just look for your sneakers. Then lace them up and get moving.\n\nExercise can turn back the clock, jumpstart your energy, and restore your health.\n\nThat\u2019s the message we heard over and over when we asked the SilverSneakers Facebook community for a dose of fitness inspiration. Some said they didn\u2019t start exercising until they were well into their 60s, but a desire to thrive in their retirement years sparked their interest.\n\nOthers fell out of the fitness habit during the hustle and bustle of raising families and building careers in midlife. Often, a health scare is what lit the fire to move more.\n\nWhatever the reason, this group is clearly on to something. Physical activity is key to a happier, healthier life for older adults, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\n\nThose findings are backed up by reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which boasts that exercise is good for your heart, muscles, bones, brain and emotional well-being.\n\nStaying physically active as you get older helps protect against some of the biggest health problems older adults face, including:\n\nHeart disease\nStroke\nDiabetes\nFalls\nDaily physical activity has also been shown to help ward off dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, reports the CDC. In fact, one study showed that cognitive decline is almost twice as common among adults who aren\u2019t active compared to those who are.\n\nGet and stay active with SilverSneakers! Classes and events are happening right now at participating gyms, online through SilverSneakers LIVE, and at community centers near you. Activate your free online account to get started.\n\nAs for that fountain of youth? Getting at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week has been linked to a 20% lower risk of early death from any cause, according to a 2022 report from the American Heart Association.\n\nBut even small amounts of activity \u2014 five to 10 minutes, if that\u2019s what you can manage \u2014 can help your health. In other words, exercise won\u2019t make you live forever, but it could help you live longer and better.\n\nHere, SilverSneakers community members share the steps they\u2019ve taken to prioritize their fitness, no matter how many birthdays they\u2019ve celebrated.\n\nStep #1: Start Small\nMaybe you haven\u2019t played sports since high school, or maybe you\u2019ve never exercised before. That\u2019s okay. Starting small is good, and just starting is even better.\n\nJust ask Lori H., who started SilverSneakers classes after she retired at 68. Now in her mid-70s, she says, \u201cI am in the best shape of my life. I can do over 12 pushups from the floor and hold the plank for 90 seconds. My clothes fit better, and I have the energy now to hike in North Carolina with my husband.\u201d\n\nLori finds inspiration among her fellow exercisers. She points out, \u201cThere are ladies in my class who are in their late 80s and two who are 90.\u201d\n\nStep #2: Find a Workout Partner\nIdeally, recruit someone around your own age. Seniors stick to their fitness routines best when they work out together, science says.\n\nIn fact, older adults who participated in a fitness program with others in their age group were three times more likely to come to exercise classes, according to researchers from the University of British Columbia.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of camaraderie that keeps Linda J. showing up for workouts.\n\n\u201cI started in my 60s after being diagnosed with diabetes,\u201d she says. \u201cI go to a senior center, and I love the group \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t do it at home on my own!\u201d\n\nStep #3: Ignore Your Excuses\nIt may be great to have a friend to exercise with, but if you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t be nervous. Take a deep breath and do it anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for your spouse or buddy to get started,\u201d says Susan S., who started yoga at 60 and SilverSneakers classes at 67.\n\n\u201cIf I had waited for those folks, I\u2019d still be waiting \u2014 and 22 pounds heavier,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be your own advocate and care about yourself and your well-being. You deserve to feel good!\u201d\n\nPlus, you never know \u2014 you could meet your new best friend. \u201cI\u2019ve met some wonderful, interesting, fun folks,\u201d Susan says.\n\nAnd those new friends come with health benefits.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e89f7ea-ad27-49ee-a4fd-198352c5f122": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e89f7ea-ad27-49ee-a4fd-198352c5f122", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05434a84-88e1-4747-a662-0d4dc5b66b03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "6bd86a59a3bf34324316c9df1c14c4dadda1fc33860de76a63b715649e54ecc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a650b79-c167-481c-83a5-3ee1de0aae41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "7f5f6bb0d4eb932472b5d495430333f5c012c0a263ce389c5d0184e2f564e358", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbdd2859-60b2-4ac2-bd60-16a9e1e98f73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "040efd513d0c6edc9e144987b922c5f97fc2f50ea880b6819f632d73b7b39f13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a5b9c3326835e6d072b8c95aa0ba3f6830fec8fa9f5ab5af6171655facc4af5", "text": "\u201cI go to a senior center, and I love the group \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t do it at home on my own!\u201d\n\nStep #3: Ignore Your Excuses\nIt may be great to have a friend to exercise with, but if you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t be nervous.

Social isolation is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes per day, according to Brigham Young University researchers. Maintaining strong relationships can improve your health and quality of life.\n\nStep #4: Embrace New Experiences\nIn her 60s, Bunny D. was an exercise newbie. \u201cI\u2019d never been active,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I moved in to take care of my mom, and I need to be strong to care for her.\u201d\n\nBunny started with a SilverSneakers water aerobics class and soon added walking. Things really took off from there.\n\nShe\u2019s even walked-jogged two 5Ks, she says. In one race, she finished first in her age group. And in the other, second.\n\nYour body isn\u2019t the only thing that will benefit from new challenges. Learning and trying new things keeps the brain healthy and cuts your risk of dementia.\n\nStep #5: Make It a Habit\nRobin H. was always active \u2014 bicycling, gardening, riding horses \u2014 but she never went to the gym. That changed after surviving cancer and recovering from a heart attack in her early 60s.\n\n\u201cI turned into a gym rat,\u201d she says. At first, her workout schedule was tough. \u201cBut it became the backbone of my life. It gave my life order, purpose, and a challenge.\u201d\n\nNow in her 70s, Robin exercises three to four times a week. \u201cWhat keeps me going is how good I feel physically and how much I enjoy the accomplishment. Exercise is a part of my life now, and I feel privileged every time I go to the gym.\u201d\n\nStep #6: Start Again If You Need To\nIf you grew up very active but put exercise on the back burner in your 30s or 40s because \u201clife got in the way and work took too much time,\u201d Susan B. understands completely.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I knew, I was 59 and had a double mastectomy,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so depressed. I was using a cane, was very overweight, and wouldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror.\u201d\n\nBut Susan\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end there. \u201cI realized I was not going to live long the way I was going,\u201d she says.\n\nShe joined a senior activity center. \u201cI met so many people like me. We encourage each other and support each other,\u201d she says.\n\nBy her late 60s, Susan was walking a couple of miles at a time without a cane. She also goes to a chair yoga class three days a week, and has learned to use fitness equipment at her gym. She\u2019s even taking fewer pain medications.\n\nMore than that, she has a positive outlook on life. \u201cI\u2019m happier, and I know I have many more happy days to come.\u201d\n\nHer top tip? \u201cGet up and tell yourself you are worth it \u2014 then go have fun!\u201d", "start_char_idx": 3694, "end_char_idx": 6906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbdd2859-60b2-4ac2-bd60-16a9e1e98f73": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbdd2859-60b2-4ac2-bd60-16a9e1e98f73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Age_Gap.txt", "file_name": "Age_Gap.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2911, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "487ace14-51c4-44b3-a5f4-1129a905b871", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Age_Gap.txt", "file_name": "Age_Gap.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2911, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "d0552fa3381a6fc3363bdc145f27e2c5080b81aa7d57d2e03b77fdead52210ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e89f7ea-ad27-49ee-a4fd-198352c5f122", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "5a5b9c3326835e6d072b8c95aa0ba3f6830fec8fa9f5ab5af6171655facc4af5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ae593bd-87ae-444e-be78-061eb5c252f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ec39009394c0121b727eb9b0e4db126c69fce86ea1a74d257b089b54eb4ab72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "040efd513d0c6edc9e144987b922c5f97fc2f50ea880b6819f632d73b7b39f13", "text": "These are the frustrations I experience as a mature man working wih 20 and 30 somethings\n\nMan, lemme tell you, working in tech at 62 is like being a classic rock song in a playlist full of EDM hits. You're not everyone's go-to, but you've got your own charm. I might not have grown up with smartphones glued to my hand, but I've got this whole \"wise elder\" vibe going, you know?\n\nThe joys are real. The young guns around me are just brimming with energy and fresh ideas. It's like being around a bunch of Teslas while I'm the trusty ol' pickup truck. And you bet that gives me a kind of exhilarating energy boost. Every time I see them tackle problems and come up with innovative solutions, it makes me feel like I'm a part of something groundbreaking, like I'm still \"in the game\" so to speak.\n\nBut oh boy, the frustrations? Cue the dramatic music. See, I'm a social animal, always have been. Give me a good joke, and I'll give you a belly laugh you won't forget. But despite my charming personality (if I do say so myself) and my best attempts at humor, I just can't seem to bridge that generational gap.\n\nIt's like they're speaking a different language sometimes. They talk in memes, GIFs, and references to shows that\u2014no kidding\u2014I've never heard of. And don't get me started on their social media lingo. \"Hey, did you see that tweet from so-and-so? Totally went viral!\" Uh, sure, but when I was your age, \"going viral\" was something you wanted to avoid.\n\nWhat really stings is the after-work hangouts. They'll huddle up, making plans for drinks or some weekend escapade, and I'm just standing there like a decoration, usually left out of the invite. Ouch. I've tried to initiate outings myself, even learned how to create a \"group chat,\" but the response is always lukewarm. I end up feeling like that kid in school who throws a party but nobody shows up. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like they're outright ignoring me. We'll have short conversations, and they'll politely laugh at my jokes\u2014especially the dad jokes, go figure\u2014but it doesn't go beyond that. It's like we're on two different frequencies and can't quite tune into each other.\n\nSo what's a 62-year-old guy to do? I've considered going full-on \"cool grandpa\" mode: rocking some trendier outfits, maybe getting a hipster haircut. But who am I kidding? That's not me. Instead, I'm focusing on what I can bring to the table: experience, wisdom, and a killer playlist of classic rock songs.\n\nI might not be in the \"in-crowd,\" but I've got my own flavor of cool. And who knows, maybe one day these young whipper-snappers will realize that a little classic rock mixes pretty well with EDM. Until then, I'll keep strumming my own tune, enjoying the ride and dealing with the bumps in the road. After all, I've been around the block a few times; I know that every friendship, just like a good song, takes time to become a hit.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2887, "text_template":

Before you continue here, if you haven't already, make sure you have your Neon SDK installed and have PyCharm installed as well. I'll link the two videos for those below. Let's get started.\n\nSkill Intro\nOkay, so we're going to make a new skill for Neon today and we're just going to make a launcher skill. So, a skill where you can say 'launch a program', and it will launch that program.\n\nAVMusic Skill Example\nTo start we're going to look at AV Music here. So, this is just an example of a skill we have that uses the Adapt intent builder and if we scroll down, there are some aspects of every skill that look very much the same. They're all going to be a subset of Mycroft skill and we're going to have this init function and also I'm going to have this initialize function where we register our intents.\n\nSkill File Structure\nSo, if we look over in our folder structure, I've already made a launcher skill outline, kind of. We have the folder for the skill, our dialog and vocab sub-directories, both with US English is the only language in there, and then we have our init file.\n\nWriting our Skill Intent If I pull that up, it's so far empty, so we're going to fill that in. Since this is a launcher skill, we need to be able to launch programs; to do that we're going to use subprocess, which is a module that basically lets you run a command as you would run it in a terminal. We're also going to use Adapt as I mentioned previously, so we're going to need to import the intent builder there. This is a skill so we need to import the parent skill; so from mycroft.skills.core import mycroft skill, and then lastly, I always import our log, especially when you're creating something new or making changes. It's good to put log statements around things to see where something failed if it fails. Alright so we're going to do class launcher skill, and that is a Mycroft skill, and then our init. We're not initializing any variables so we are only going to have this one line under our init and this is just following convention of mycroft skills. And then we're going to make our initialize function, and this is where we register our intents. All right, so let's look at take a look at what I just typed up here. So, we're defining this launch chromium intent using the intent builder we imported from Adapt. We're naming that intent launch chromium intent, and we told it it's going to require a launch keyword and it's going to require a chromium keyword, and then we told it to build. So this is a pretty common formula you'll see, we'll get into that with some variations a little bit later. So now what we need to do is we need to actually register that intent to something. So we need to tell it when it matches what it's going to do. And this is all just following convention, this self dot launch chromium intent is a function we're going to write here in just a moment. It's just convention that this defined name matches this defined name, so it's not like we're calling something recursively. They just match the names for convention's sake.\n\nWriting our Skill Function\nAnd we're going to pass it this message parameter. Message is an object that contains things like what you actually said and what these key words are that it found. So, for debugging, I always like to just log message.data. This can help if you are trying to pull a lot of key words out of something, or you just want to see what keywords you found; some other stuff like that. It's always good to put a self.speak under any intent match. That just means that Neon will say something when it matches. You could leave this out, and just have it call up a program, but it makes a lot more sense to have it say something, so you know why that program launched for example. I'm going to use sub-process here to launch chromium and then you give it a parameter of a website to go to. And then if we look here, we have a warning that we're not implementing all of our abstract methods.\n\n'stop' Abstract Method\nI'm just going to pop over to the Mycroft skill, and I know which method this is, so I'm just going to search for it. So, stop is an abstract method that every skill should implement.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4283, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "573830e1-f960-4464-93ff-db8f51b5fa6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "573830e1-f960-4464-93ff-db8f51b5fa6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e5c0843-bea9-4ddc-a563-95ea56be8206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "3595586828146c83f65701048c3cd09efba443c1711912ede7254f7623b2ad9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc6c8a62-1c65-4c28-bd7f-376588fd4171", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "35d8dd9ffae74d17ca769aa5cedd603ef76641e676030563bfca2f76fc3494ed", "text": "It's always good to put a self.speak under any intent match.

I'm going to use sub-process here to launch chromium and then you give it a parameter of a website to go to. And then if we look here, we have a warning that we're not implementing all of our abstract methods.\n\n'stop' Abstract Method\nI'm just going to pop over to the Mycroft skill, and I know which method this is, so I'm just going to search for it. So, stop is an abstract method that every skill should implement. From this particular skill, we don't have any processes that we would need to explicitly stop, so it's just going to pass. But say you had something like AV Music, if I go back to our example there. It has stop and what it has to do is it has to for example disable the pause intent, because if it's not playing anything, there's nothing to pause and it also has to kill the process-- so the-- in this case, MPV, which is playing the audio and video.\n\nFinishing Up Our Skill init\nFor this skill, we just want it to launch the program. We don't want it to track it, we don't want it to have to close it at a later time; it's just going to launch it and then be done. And then the last part we have to add here is our create skill method, and all that's going to do is return our class. And that is our completed skill init, now I'm going to look at our keywords here. We have a launch keyword and we have a chromium keyword, so those need to be added.\n\nCreating .voc Files\nIf we go over to our vocab directory and then we made our en-us. I'm going to make a new file here, and this is going to be the same string I used here in require, with the file extension .voc. We'll add that and then this file, basically one per line, we're going to add what words mean launch. So for this example I'm going to say launch and I'm going to say open. So, either launch or open will fulfill this requirement and then we're going to do the same thing for chromium. Add that to our git, and for chromium I'll just say chromium, also Chrome, or browser; and I think that makes sense. So as long as we have one word from our launch keyword and one word from our chromium keyword, this function will be called. So now I'm going to commit these changes, and we'll give it a test.\n\nTesting our Skill Okay, so we have pulled our changes on our test machine here, so now we're going to test our new skill just by saying launch Chrome. (launching Chrome) And it works. (welcome to neongecko.com, thanks for being a developer. While you're here, make sure to check out some of our information on our neon SDK or maybe check out our Klat adaptive forums, which also integrate our neon AI.)\n\nAdding Functionality (More Programs)\nSo, now that we know our skill works, we're going to make some additions to make it a little more useful. Instead of just launching Chrome we're going to add some options for other programs. So if I want to add our file explorer as an option, I'm going to need to make a new keyword. So I'll add NautilusKeyword.voc. Nautilus is Ubuntu's file explorer. I'll go ahead and add nautilus, files, file explorer. And now for our intent, we're going to modify this. We don't want to require the chromium keyword now, since we're adding another option, so we're going to change this to optionally and then we're going to add also optionally Nautilus.\n\nModifying our Launcher Function\nSo, we have those changes, now we need to change our intent, and this isn't really chromium anymore, so I'm going to refactor this and just name it launch program intent. And same with our function. Perfect. So, that looks better and then we'll add this if message.data.get ChromiumKeyword, then we'll launch Chrome. I'm just going to copy this and just change this to Nautilus, and now we have the same thing for our file browser. I'm going to add one more for our terminal in the same way. We'll add another optionally here and we'll do another copy and paste.", "start_char_idx": 3574, "end_char_idx": 7725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc6c8a62-1c65-4c28-bd7f-376588fd4171": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc6c8a62-1c65-4c28-bd7f-376588fd4171", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "573830e1-f960-4464-93ff-db8f51b5fa6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "35d8dd9ffae74d17ca769aa5cedd603ef76641e676030563bfca2f76fc3494ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e58a5f53-60ba-4931-80ad-19d4c2e0aef2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af081c392e0efc5e544569295462b49b0c32aa7836011420d4cd8e33c5127c4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "text": "And now for our intent, we're going to modify this.

We'll add another optionally here and we'll do another copy and paste. So that's going to be an else if.\n\nUsing Dialog Files for Speech\nSo now what we're going to do, is we're going to change the way we handle the speaking. Since these are all very similar we're basically just going to say launching, and then the name of the program we're launching. We can use a dialog file to make that a little simpler. So to do that, instead of speaking for each one, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this variable program. I'm going to start that out as None and then, depending on the program we match, I'm going to assign a value. And then at the very end of this, I'm going to say if program self.speak dialog launch program and feed it this dictionary that has key program, with value whatever this variable evaluates to. And then I'm going to put in this else statement let's get self.peak I don't know that program.\n\nAnalyzing Our Skill Logic\nSo let's look at how this will work. Our intent builder is going to require launch that's the only requirement here, so if it hears the word launch or open, the two that we put in our vocab file, then its going to call this intent. Once it gets here, it's going to look for chromium or chromium key word in the message. If it doesn't find that it'll look for a nautilus one. If it doesn't find that in to look for terminal. If it doesn't find that, it's still going to continue here. But since we started program out as none, unless it matches one of these three, program is going to have a value of none, so we'll get this message of \"I don't know that program.\" If it does match one of these, then it's going to speak this dialogue, and we need to tell it what this dialogue is.\n\nAdding Another Dialog File\nSo, if we go back over to our dialogue directory, and under language. And we name it with this string we used here .dialog. text, and to our git. And then I'm just going to type in launching {{program}}. So, any of these values in these double curly braces, it's going to look for in the dictionary we pass it.\n\nRunning More Tests So I'm going to minimize this, and I have Neon running here I just have the mic muted here, so we're going to unmute the mic and give it a test. Launch Chrome. (launching Chrome) And we get exactly what we expect. So if we want to do some further testing, since we have skip Wake words enabled here ,it should be transcribing everything I'm saying. So if I were to without pausing say launch Chrome it should still launch Chrome. And it did. And another important part of testing here is to test things that we wouldn't expect to match to make sure we get an expected result. So, an example would be if I were to just say launch. And it were to transcribe correctly as launch. (I don't know that program). We get the response we expected, because it went through that else where program was none and it just said it doesn't know that program. And then the other case that we talked about, if I were to say launch chromium and File Explorer (launching Chrome) it's only going to match the first one in that statement which means the order I said it didn't really matter. I could just as easily say launch file explorer and chromium, and it could transcribe correctly. Launch file explorer and chromium. (launching Chrome) and it still launches chrome because that's the first one it looks for.", "start_char_idx": 6894, "end_char_idx": 11035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e58a5f53-60ba-4931-80ad-19d4c2e0aef2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e58a5f53-60ba-4931-80ad-19d4c2e0aef2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc6c8a62-1c65-4c28-bd7f-376588fd4171", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "992a1db9-fe28-46fb-b39d-9e40a323c02e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f087064968216d7886c1b4517f3a7c13d2ba67777277fe11a9a5dfb654b90bdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "af081c392e0efc5e544569295462b49b0c32aa7836011420d4cd8e33c5127c4b", "text": "And it did.

(launching Chrome) and it still launches chrome because that's the first one it looks for.\n\nHandling Imperfect Transcriptions\nBut this brings up another point of Google transcription isn't perfect, and launch and lunch seem to be fairly similar words it's going to match. So what I can do to improve our success rate with the skill is to go back to our vocab file and I can just add lunch as one of our words there, and this may not make a lot of sense looking at it, but when you look at some of the quirks of the transcriptions, this is a useful way to make it a little more reliable.\n\nTesting with Wake Words Enabled\nSo with that testing done, I'm just going to quickly turn wake words back on and make sure we get expected behavior in that mode. We didn't do anything in the skill that was explicitly dependent on wake words, so this shouldn't make a difference but it's still good to test.\n\nHey Neon, launch file explorer (launching file explorer)\n\nHey Neon, launch terminal (launching terminal)\n\nHey Neon, launch. (I don't know that program)\n\nAnd we get the same behavior that we would expect, matching what happened when we were skipping wake words.\n\nThanks for watching this Neon AI tutorial.

Let's get started. PYTHON REGEX\n\nReview and Overview\nSo in the last video, we tested our launcher skill. We had it set up to launch one of four programs, depending on what we said, and now we're going to look at that and think about what would happen as we started adding programs to this list. So right now, we just have our intent that requires a launch keyword and then optionally any of the other program keywords that we manually input. And then based on that, it's going to launch one of those programs. But if we add -- as we add more programs, that can get a little bit cumbersome, so we're going to look at using regular expressions to filter out a program name from a message, without telling it what the options of that name are.\n\nCreating a Regex File So to do that we have our regex directory inside of our skill, and then our language underneath that, similar to our vocab and dialogue. And this one I've named program.rx, and what we're going to do with that is if we look at our launch keywords, I'm going to say one of those -- any of those -- so launch, lunch, or open, and then the word that follows that is our program. And this follows the Python conventions for regular expressions, I'll put a link to that in the description here. But what this means, it's going to look for one of these three words and then whatever comes next is going to be our program.\n\nAdding to Skill init and Modifying Intents\nSo looking back at our init file, we'll see there are some changes. We've moved our options for each program into our init. So instead of the .voc files we had before, now we just have these lists of words that match for each program, and we've actually removed the .voc files that we are previously using. Our intent builder also looks a little different accordingly. So we still have required our launch keyword, and now we also have required a program, which it gets from our regex file we just looked at, and then we also have this optionally Neon, which we'll take a look at in a moment. But what this means now is it needs to see you say \"launch something\" or \"Neon launch something\" before it activates. So the word launch should no longer just call this skill.\n\nHandling False Positives\nSo moving into our intent, we added this if statement, and if we look at this, we're saying: if we are skipping wake words and we have Neon in our message, then we'll continue. Or if we are not skipping wake words then we will continue. So you'll see this in a number of skills, it's useful to cut down on the number of false activations, especially a word like launch or lunch will quite probably come up in everyday conversation, and this way you won't have Neon interrupting and saying \"I couldn't find that\", every time it hears launch or lunch. So for this to work we've added our Neon.voc file here next to our launch keyword. If we take a look at that it basically just contains neon and then some other common transcriptions, similar to how we have lunch in our launch one.\n\nChanges to Our Function\nSo looking back at our function here, we've changed this around so program is now getting extracted from the message data, whereas before we were assigning it based on some other words in our message data. So now we've changed the logic to: we assume we have a match, we go through, and if we get one of the programs out of the list that we defined earlier, then we launch that program in the same way. So if Chrome then Chrome, else if Nautilus then Nautilus, terminal, Text Edit, etc. and then we've added this else, so if the program wasn't in any of these lists, then we say we did not find a match. If we did find a match, we speak dialogue the same way we did previously, and now if we don't find a match, we instead of using the speak statement we were before, we have another dialogue. If we look at that dialogue, file it's going to tell us \"I could not find a program named\", and then whatever program it heard. So, this is nice because you get a more specific response.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4243, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7820443e-9fde-4a4b-bf2d-5898f97d1b23": {"__data__": {"id_": "7820443e-9fde-4a4b-bf2d-5898f97d1b23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e26a92-4948-4b20-a7a5-9671204d82bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "ba60abda17a9aa0058cdeb29d2894fc8619f1190e00e8c9b9729df7f3a670fb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "992a1db9-fe28-46fb-b39d-9e40a323c02e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "f087064968216d7886c1b4517f3a7c13d2ba67777277fe11a9a5dfb654b90bdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4b53353-e992-4e78-9a33-49554407e24f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "25b08f8c05baf31fcdd2a2869cacd915afee9b9b4c334602fd317d31a1bd5c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2730f426fd878aecc4ed3967a63002b37e23f5785b7d3a05cc671bc4e8788e90", "text": "So now we've changed the logic to: we assume we have a match, we go through, and if we get one of the programs out of the list that we defined earlier, then we launch that program in the same way.

If we look at that dialogue, file it's going to tell us \"I could not find a program named\", and then whatever program it heard. So, this is nice because you get a more specific response. Also, you'll find maybe a program that should have matched, kind of like how we had launch and lunch earlier, and it'll tell you what it heard, and you can say okay that should be added to one of these lists. So with that we're going to give this a test.\n\nTesting our Changes Okay so now let's give those changes a test. If I were to say launch Chrome, we shouldn't have anything happen because we're skipping Wake words, and I didn't say our keyword. If I say neon launch Chrome, (launching Chrome) then we get Chrome as we would expect. So I'm just gonna close that and go ahead and enable our wake words, so we can give that a try. So now if I say hey neon, launch Nautilus (launching Nautilus) we get our file explorer and even if I say hey Neon, Neon launch File Explorer (launching File Explorer) it'll still launch the file explorer. So, regardless of the Neon in front when we have wake words enabled, it will do- it will still parse out whatever is after our keyword. So, I'll close that out and then try something we don't have. Hey Neon, launch Neon (sorry I could not find neon) and that's exactly what we expected.\n\nSummary and Closing\nSo that's an example of how you can use a regex file to simplify some of your intent building, and also how to get some more data out of the messages. So in the next video, we're going to look at instead of using Adapt, moving to Padatious and that will simplify things a little bit more here as well. Thanks for watching this Neon AI tutorial.

Title:You're Not Lazy: How to Live a Chaotically Organised Life  Content: [Music] if you are picking a brain and one listens to everything you try to do works according to plans sticks the schedules is obedient and calm and the second is a hellscape of chaos and obsession lacks all sense of structure organization just love staying up until 3am overthinking every night i mean you'd pick the first one right everything seems to be built for type 1 brains in a world full of success stories based on consistency atomic habits and self-disciplined routine it can seem impossible to succeed withoutjust that and so for the longest time all i've wanted was a different brain one that would actually listen to me because as someone who has never been able to create any sense of long-term structure if you can relate to me at all here is how i think we can end up right where our consistent habit-forming friends are without ever needing to be consistent or create habits because even though on the outside i realize it looks as though i'm an organized person i run this youtube channel by myself i have apodcast and jobs and school but the thing is on the inside it's probably not what you think it is so let's just get straight into it i'm going to start my case against consistency and habit formation using my younger self as an example because i feel that she had a much better grasp on how to organize myself so i'm going to get a slight cringe pass here but when i was younger i was very good academically at the end of the year i would always have the best grades i would win olympiads i would getall types of reward for excellent academic achievement so you would presumably think that i was a very organized and well put together student and this is not the case on any given day of the year if you were to zoom in chances are i had forgotten what subjects i had that day i might have left my homework at home or had never done my homework because i'd forgotten to do it or sometimes very cheekily i just didn't want to do it and so i very often kind of fell behind during the year but this was completely normal tome i always recognized that sometimes i didn't feel like doing something so i fell behind and then i got interested in it so i caught up and then i got very interested in it so i went ahead and this fall behind catch up and go ahead schedule was very natural to me very often on the same day that i was behind on something that night i would study the next three months of that subject that we hadn't even done yet so i would go ahead everyone else i was just using my passion when i wanted to do things and one of the most important things i'dhad to reteach myself as an adult is that falling behind is not quitting it's just a third of the story because i feel as though when i got older and i got used to seeing everyone being super consistent and having these habits as soon as i didn't do something for a while i thought that i had quit and that i'm just not as good as everyone else at this thing and it's not right for me when this is not the full story being a chaos and passion driven person falling behind is just a third of the storysometimes i don't do things but it's guaranteed that if i genuinely want to do them i will catch up and go ahead much later and this has been such an important thing for me to relearn i generally believe that consistency is not for everyone and those of us who cannot adapt it end up quitting so many things just because we think that we can't be consistent and therefore we cannot do it i know it's not the best thing in the world but sometimes i go to gym five times a week for a few months in a row and sometimes i won't go to thegym at all for five months but i know that this doesn't mean that i hate exercising because i'm going to want to do it again and i'm going to catch up on the progress that i missed out on during that time when i genuinely didn't feel like doing it just because i stopped does not mean that i have quit something forever douglas adams has a quote that i really relate to when he says that i love deadlines i love the wishing noise they make as they go by and

he says that i love deadlines i love the wishing noise they make as they go by and this is so relatable for me any sort of artificialdeadlines are just not serious enough for me to use and therefore even though that i know that there are some harsh deadlines in life for example when i was younger i had end of your exams now as an adult i need to hand projects in i have other things that i need to do for work but in between now and then i do not create any real deadlines anything that i put in my calendar is a suggestion it's not something that i need to do it's more like if i feel like it i might do this today but just because i skip it one two three fourfive six times in a row does that mean that i cannot catch up on this thing later or that i'm not good at this thing at all i only treat real deadlines like deadlines all the arbitrary ones are suggestions and i don't create any sort of self-hate or hatred for the thing that i'm doing around them now i'm very comfortable never being a consistent habit farming girl but always being a full-behind catch-up and go ahead girl because just like it used to do well for me academically when i was younger ithonestly does really well for me in life right now because it's just the way i work and this leads me very comfortably onto what's perhaps a very controversial point which is screw one percent improvements i love james clear his book atomic habits is really really good but it genuinely has caused me a lot of damage because when i saw his one percent improvement graphs which is basically the thought that if you keep improving at something just one percent every single day by the end of the year you will be exponentially better at thisthing which is really really true it's a hundred percent true so i looked at this graph and my heart just sank because i realized i could never do this i could never do something consistently for a year because the best way to get me to hate something or to quit something is to make a strict schedule for it if you tell me elizabeth you need to do this thing three times a week for the next two months there's no chance i'm just going to leave it and so i realized that it's never going to work because onepercent improvements only work if you do things very consistently if you do things three times a month and you improve one percent every time you're getting absolutely nowhere and even worse if you do things twice a year and you improve only one percent at them that's no improvement you're going to stop doing these things because as frederick hesburgh in the harvard business review identified something that we probably all know intuitively of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress whichbasically means the better we get at something the more we want to do it and this one percent improvements only works if you're consistent and so i'm stuck in this conundrum where i have to be consistent in order to improve and so i can never improve or want to do everything and i'm always stuck with low level motivation for everything in my life this is where my method comes in basically what i've decided is to completely screw the one percent improvement and go for five percent 500 5000 improvements every single time andgenuinely this is how i've learned my skills this is how i've learned to draw to paint to edit and everything so i'm going to explain how i do this specifically if you are also a chaotic passionate person hopefully this might work for you a few years ago i wanted to learn 3d animation because i saw people who create the video game characters and stuff and i thought oh my god this looks so cool i want to learn how to do it the way to quit this for me is to go okay so twice a week for the next six months i'mgoing to slowly learn how to 3d anime no no this would never work what i do instead is that i do nothing but i just passively kind of look at animations here and there so whenever i'm procrastinating or i

whenever i'm procrastinating or i have some free time i'll just go through my phone and i'll look at really good 3d animated work and what i'm doing here is that i'm passively priming my brain to get passionate about this thing and to fall in love with this thing and i'm not allowing myself to start the work because i'm just doing this thing slowlyand slowly and slowly and at some points i'll reach a tipping point while i go straight i need to learn this right now because i can't wait to learn this so then i'll just sit down and honestly i had never done any work before in my life i sat down and i sat for maybe 10 to 15 hours on my laptop and i taught myself from nothing to be basically quite good at learning to animate and then on the second day i created this and i'll show it on screen on the third day i was really good i created this soin three days i learned something that admittedly i could have pieced myself and done for a very long time if i was different i just can't do things that way so i went for like 10 000 improvements basically in the space of three days which otherwise i would have never been able to achieve because if i would have tried to get to one percent improvement i would have quit very very early on so this is how i learn skills without creating habits i prime myself for extreme passion and then i get to do them and also another huge benefit ofthis is that you get to learn things so much faster and with so much more focus because as much as i envy and i'm so jealous of consistent and organized people because they can do so many things the one thing that i think i'm a lot better at is deep work i don't understand why people struggle with deep work i'm always falling into deep work and i think it's because they pace themselves too much and they create these short schedules or i'm only going to do this for 40 minutes a day if yousit into it if you get in the proper mood to want to do something properly you can get extreme levels of focus and therefore crazy results and because for my personal projects and things that i want to work on i only work in a deep work state i can get so much more done and learn a lot faster and therefore i'm leveraging huge amounts of passion huge amounts of focus the best kind of state of mind for learning to get extreme results really really fast without one percent improvements so yeah this is how i hack my brain into learning things nowi'm pretty sure a lot of you might be thinking this really doesn't work for everything and you would be 100 right i think the toughest pill for me to swallow especially as a competitive person is the realization that there are certain things in life that i will just never be good at i know this is hard to say for me but it's it's just true i will never be good at memorizing facts because you need to repeat things again and again in order to remember them consistently it's not for me i loveexercise but i will never be a bodybuilder because it takes ridiculous amounts of food restriction and exercise for a long amount of time to get somewhere and i can absolutely never do that but this doesn't mean that i can't learn some things or that i can't enjoy exercise so i think that in my life i do not optimize for consistency i optimize for passion because even though there are some things that i'm always going to be really bad at there are some things that i'm always very very good at i canget inhumane amounts of work done in a short burst of time i can learn huge amounts of information in short periods of time and also i have a very creative bigger picture mind because i touch things intensively and then i leave them for a very long time so when i come back to them i can see things differently so i am very good at bigger picture

being a passionate person because that's where i can shine there's this very interesting study that showed that 50 of the amount of work done in a company is done by the top 10 of workers and also the best performer is a hundred times more productive than the lowest performer in the company and this doesn't mean that we should all aim to be the most productive person butbasically what that means is that these people who are at the top are probably having a lot more fun and also just in their natural element so i think recognizing my strengths recognizing the things that i'm good at and

I swear, it's like an impulse I can't control. I'm that guy, the one who finds a shortcut or a new piece of software and just has to share it with the team. You know, because if it blew my mind, it's gotta rock theirs too, right?\n\nEvery time I find a way to make our workflow more efficient or discover a tech hack that's nothing short of miraculous, I feel like a kid who's just found a hidden treasure. I can't help but shout, \"Eureka!\"\u2014well, not literally, but you get the picture. I draft the email, create the presentation, or seize the moment at team meetings to unveil my latest tech marvel. \"This,\" I think, \"is gonna change everything!\"\n\nThe reactions are always encouraging at first. Eyes widen, people nod, there are a few \"wow\"s and \"that's cool\"s sprinkled in. But that's where it ends. Nobody adopts the new method. No follow-up questions. It's like I've shown them a magic trick and they applaud, but no one wants to learn how it's done. Talk about an anticlimax.\n\nAnd that's the kicker. I can't shake this feeling that if I just kept my mouth shut and let someone stumble upon my genius organically, they might actually take an interest. Like, if they discovered it in the wild, in the course of our work, it would have that \"found treasure\" allure. But my impulses get the best of me, and I can't help but speed up the reveal.\n\nIt's frustrating, you know? Here I am, with my bag of tech tricks, ready to make all our lives easier, and I'm met with polite applause but no curtain calls. It's like being a stand-up comedian where everyone laughs but no one remembers your jokes after the show. \n\nYet, despite all this, I can't quash that urge to share, to impress, to try to elevate our work. Maybe it's ego, maybe it's enthusiasm, or maybe it's just the eternal optimist in me hoping that next time will be different. Next time, they'll not only say \"wow,\" but also, \"show me how.\"\n\nSo, until that day comes, I'll keep tinkering, exploring, and yes, prematurely unveiling my tech discoveries. Because who knows? Maybe one day, my penchant for fast-tracking will actually fast-track something amazing for all of us. And man, won't that be a story to tell?", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "095814ae-1912-475c-805f-93b0d1d551ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "095814ae-1912-475c-805f-93b0d1d551ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_name": "Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4815, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "edea787f-b982-473c-bf4d-41552d0a8948", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_name": "Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4815, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "8d30972f76fc0b6d4c109a135e477e18b0c81137835b08026c54294b08cabd5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b34a784f-1dd4-412c-8280-68d855cfb020", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Impress.txt", "file_name": "Impress.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2305, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "ee25beb9ee18d84d53706c113ffc96fa7b48571711477b41241bbdd35c055e09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb602c8e-50e8-4140-a90c-2d51a7eb5d5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b725c06307c32609430d83443df9933a428b53c9ed0cf0a42258a85ee4ff98e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3ff560b34e67d5cff1ef4c14ffafa8c0fbd6378a6027dd649ab76b899140afb7", "text": "My Wife Has No Sex Drive \u2013 What Can I Do?\nIf your wife or partner is exhibiting low sex drive, it\u2019s time to have an open conversation with them. The best thing you can do for each other is to speak to a sex therapist or a marriage counselor; however, there are also other more immediate ways to put in the work to rekindle sexual vibrancy and passion.\n\nHere are eight tips you and your partner can try to help increase sexual desire:\n\n1. Speak to a Sex Therapist or Marriage Counselor\nConsider speaking with a certified sex therapist or marriage counselor. They may help you improve communication, help bring more mindfulness into the relationship, or suggest sex therapy with a sensate focus.\n\n2. Talk About Sexual Fantasies\nTry to foster a sense of openness and vulnerability between you and your partner. If you both feel safe and comfortable, talk to each other about unexplored sexual fantasies. Even if you don\u2019t act out these desires, talking about them can create more intimacy.\n\n3. Foster a Sense of Connection\nMen tend to connect through sex, while for women sex tends to be a manifestation of the connection. One of the best and fastest ways to create a sense of connection with another person is through eye contact. Sit down with her face-to-face and talk, making sure to look into her eyes periodically. Our eyes are direct links to our nervous systems, so through mutual eye contact, we can create a sense of being deeply connected in real-time with another person.\n\nAsk her to tell you the high and low points of her day. All you really need is 10-15 minutes of each other\u2019s undivided attention on a daily basis to rekindle the good vibes. That being said, it\u2019s important that she has your undivided attention. Make sure that the TV and your cell phone are off. The payoff for helping her feel connected should be much higher than anything else you could be doing with those 10 minutes.\n\n4. Plan Romantic Dates\nPut in the effort to plan a romantic date. Better yet, make date night a regular occurrence. In essence, this is simply a way to show your partner that you care and are paying attention to their needs. This kind of energy and playfulness is essential for keeping passion alive.\n\n5. Address Underlying Mental Health & Medical Issues\nOne of the most important things you can do to address low sex drive in women is to encourage them to delve into and try to manage any underlying mental and medical health issues. They can start this process by talking to a primary care physician (PCP) or a trusted therapist.\n\nLeigh Noren\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand why your desire is low,\u201d says sex therapist Leigh Nor\u00e9n. \u201cFor example, have you been having sex that isn\u2019t pleasurable, or have you recently experienced more stress at work? While these both can cause low desire, the solutions to these difficulties will vary as the root causes are completely different. Once you know what\u2019s going on underneath the surface, you can get to creating more desire. Some common solutions are exploring your sexuality, increasing emotional intimacy, communicating more openly about sex, and working on becoming more present in the moment.\u201d\n\n6. Alter Medications or Dosages\nA side effect of certain medications is a significant impact on sex drive and libido. As such, your dosage may require adjustment. In some cases, you may need to try an entirely new medication. Don\u2019t make adjustments to your dose without talking to your doctor first.\n\n7. Talk Openly & Communicate Effectively\nOpen communication is the bedrock of any healthy relationship. Tell your partner how you feel and be understanding and open to hearing about their experiences.\n\n8. Show More Affection\nSimple affection is such a powerful tool to build intimacy. Something like holding hands and other forms of non-penetrative sex can be a step toward restoring a physical connection and reinforcing an emotional bond.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\nIf you\u2019re unhappy with your sex life and feel that your libido is mismatched with your partner\u2019s, it\u2019s a good time to seek professional help. Also, if your or your partner\u2019s libido falls abruptly and doesn\u2019t recover in a couple of weeks, make an appointment as soon as possible. If you need help finding a couples counselor, browse through the profiles of professionals on an online therapist directory.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nConcern about your or your partner\u2019s low libido can be a stressful, lonely experience. Talk to each other, and don\u2019t be afraid to contact a therapist to facilitate the discussion and help you find answers. Ultimately, stay curious and compassionate toward each other. Sex can be important to a relationship and a wonderful part of a healthy life and partnership, so don\u2019t give up on each other.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb602c8e-50e8-4140-a90c-2d51a7eb5d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb602c8e-50e8-4140-a90c-2d51a7eb5d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_name": "Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1155, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ff5fb68-1f18-47b2-86d9-681ed59e21d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_name": "Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1155, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "302cb9d13dec190aecd5822c7a566b631cd7034133dc835c7c4ff113be7578ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "095814ae-1912-475c-805f-93b0d1d551ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_name": "Lack_of_Interest.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4815, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "3ff560b34e67d5cff1ef4c14ffafa8c0fbd6378a6027dd649ab76b899140afb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5fffbc5a-99a0-4498-85f5-22b30ea09915", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2ecf1f52ee51a6d81726bf17ff8665d5021815e954b3b3c8f03e7ea1a728b31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3b725c06307c32609430d83443df9933a428b53c9ed0cf0a42258a85ee4ff98e", "text": "Title: My Movie Preferences \n\nI like action movies with the following characteristics:\n\n- Strong, attractive, aggressive female protagonist.

Does she feel guilty when she says No? Does he take on too many commitments and then feel resentful? It can be maddening to have a partner who does everything for everyone else, but has little time or energy for you.\n\nJohn and Jill argue every year about going to spend a week with Jills parents over Christmas. Neither enjoys the visit, but Jill feels obligated to go. Jills mother is overbearing and selfish. Everything has to be about her. She guilts Jill into buying her things and doing major household projects. One year she had Jill painting the living room on Christmas Eve. John has tried to persuade Jill to stay home. One year he even proposed a trip to Hawaii instead, but Jill says she has to go to her parents. John is dreading another trip to his in-laws and hes frustrated that Jill wont compromise.\n\n\nDon doesnt seem to know how to say No. Hes heading up the church fund raising committee. Hes the Cub Scout den leader. He mows his Moms lawn every other Saturday and takes her to doctor appointments regularly. His wife, Melanie, is constantly on his case to delegate some of these tasks. Cant you ask your sister to drive your Mom this time? Tell the other parents they need to help plan the Cub Scout meetings, she suggests. But Don doesnt want to ask for help. He feels needed and important through all his volunteer work. Lets go out this weekend! It seems like forever since weve been out just the, says Melanie. But as you can imagine, Don is always busy or just plain tired. Melanie goes out with her girlfriends instead, but she feels rejected by Don.\n\nYour people-pleasing partner may not want your advice, but there are a few things you can do to help.\n\n\nSet your own healthy boundaries\n\nJust because your partner tries to please everyone, doesnt mean you have to, too. Setting healthy boundaries models for your partner that its normal and completely acceptable to say No sometimes. It also reinforces the message that everyone needs to prioritize self-care and being treated with respect. Setting boundaries also helps you to be more compassionate and less resentful.\n\nJohn wants to support his wife, but hes learned that he cant force Jill to set boundaries with her parents. He can, however, set his own boundaries. This year he decided to fly to his in-laws on the morning of Christmas Eve and leave after dinner on Christmas. This way he can spend Christmas with his wife and minimize his time with his in-laws. Jill can stay for the rest of the week. This was a healthy compromise for John and Jill.\n\nManage your own anger\n\n\nIt can be frustrating to have a people-pleasing partner. You probably watch him/her stuck in the same dysfunctional patterns and struggle with exhaustion and resentment. Youre tired of seeing your partner mistreated or taken advantage of. Or maybe youre frustrated that your partner doesnt prioritize taking better care of him/herself, doesnt reach his/her own goals, and doesnt make time to spend with you. Its understandable that youre feeling stuck, hurt, and angry, too. Since you cant change your partner, try focusing on how you can manage your own emotions. Find healthy ways to express your feelings whether its through direct communication with your partner, seeing a therapist, working out, or journaling. Its important that you acknowledge your feelings and tune into what they are telling you.\n\nBe a neutral sounding board\n\nWhen you take care of your own feelings, you can be a supportive and unbiased support for your partner. Our partners usually come to us for support, not advice. You dont have to fix your partners problems. Just be a neutral sounding board that s/he can use to bounce around ideas, unload negative feelings, and feel completely accepted despite his/her struggles and mistakes.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce03c07e-a3f0-4574-ac30-1bf03cde846c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce03c07e-a3f0-4574-ac30-1bf03cde846c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89719cc-174b-42b0-8a48-992757173fe4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "752467ce21414c4f4b93e2b721e3e1b51c999c19393d5303d325e48be2d23f0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c525d16-23d1-42f6-b312-e62c14279983", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "a1f05ece1950bf2375aca9201f40aead2e868613270597d54fffd827526d6690", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ca3c0ac-0369-4371-8ba9-cf2ad5fa5c54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a32dc3800dfa345cd8521a13c1d303a82054e232cce075d11de45ec8121c94ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "75e11bfb57d75c0b1cd1ef964695275c65fdded79c3fbbcc0496079c381f75c8", "text": "Encourage individuation\n\nOne of the most helpful things you can do for your people-pleasing partner is to encourage him/her to develop a strong and independent sense of self. Your partner has been living for everyone else, losing him or herself in the process.\n\nPSYCH CENTRAL RESOURCES\nSetting better boundaries starts here\nLearn more about defining boundaries in your relationships, practicing consistency, and living with intention with our limited series.\n\nEncourage your partner to try new things and develop new friendships. You might think Don, from the example above, has plenty of interests and activities. In actuality, he has lots to do, but these arent really things he wants to do. Theyre things he feels obligated to do or things hes done for years and he just keeps doing without considering whether theyre still things that fit his goals and priorities.\n\nYou can help your partner schedule time for him/herself. This might mean that you take on some additional responsibilities with the house or kids in order to free up some time for your partner to take a class, go out with friends, or exercise.\n\nYou can also create a safe environment for your partner to practice expressing his/her own opinions and thoughts. Have a curious approach and ask your partner for his/her opinion about everything from politics to how to spend the weekend. And then, be sure to validate his/her unique perspective. That doesnt mean you have to agree, just acknowledge, continue to be curious and non-judgmental.\n\nCommunicate clearly and respectfully\n\nCommunication is a key to every successful relationship. This is a skill that your partner probably struggles with, so you are again modeling ways for him/her to be more assertive and solve problems. Healthy communication is clear and respectful. I statements are a great way to accomplish this. Try this approach: I feel _____________ when you _______________ and Id like _____________________. John could say something like this to his wife, Jill, I feel frustrated and sad when you spend most of your vacation time at your parents. Id really like it if youd shorten your trip so that we could enjoy a few days of vacation alone.\n\nWith practice and patience and compassion, past hurts and people-pleasing patterns can be changed!", "start_char_idx": 3859, "end_char_idx": 6138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ca3c0ac-0369-4371-8ba9-cf2ad5fa5c54": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ca3c0ac-0369-4371-8ba9-cf2ad5fa5c54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Reality.txt", "file_name": "Reality.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2932, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34b89a74-3285-466c-b1d2-32491962d731", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Reality.txt", "file_name": "Reality.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2932, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "b62f44ffcd981b43b4aae33ce9cba92c378a7c371aadf63ccd553bd024daf236", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce03c07e-a3f0-4574-ac30-1bf03cde846c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "75e11bfb57d75c0b1cd1ef964695275c65fdded79c3fbbcc0496079c381f75c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3a13956-c7df-41cf-9a3b-7ce0853182f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2cdded3bc380a1e6f71b3c7b349b5ac62b4d961437a000db55cc21ae6ee7b3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a32dc3800dfa345cd8521a13c1d303a82054e232cce075d11de45ec8121c94ad", "text": "This is my philosophy on reality and the afterlife\n\nDude, sit down, because I've got a theory that'll make you feel like you're in the middle of a sci-fi movie. Ready? I genuinely think we're living in a simulated reality. Yeah, I know it sounds like a plot straight out of \"The Matrix,\" but hear me out.\n\nYou know how in video games, when your character dies, you don't throw your console away, right? You respawn and play again, maybe even in a different setting or scenario. Well, what if life is just like that? What if, when we bite the dust, our consciousness or soul or whatever just gets rebooted into another version of this reality? Mind-blowing, huh?\n\nNow, this is the kicker: I believe that our \"characters,\" you know, family, friends, colleagues\u2014the whole gang\u2014stick with us. We're all bound by some cosmic glue that keeps us in the same roles, although maybe with a few tweaks here and there. Imagine it like a TV series with multiple seasons; the characters evolve, some plotlines change, but the core group stays the same. I guess it's the universe's version of typecasting!\n\nSo, how does this shape my day-to-day decisions? Oh man, it's like having cheat codes for life! If this is a game, then I'm gonna play it the best I can, leveling up at every opportunity. That job I'm nervous about applying for? Heck, I'm going for it. That friendship I've been hesitant to invest in? Count me in. Every good decision, every risk taken, every act of kindness\u2014it's all XP in this grand game of life.\n\nYou might wonder, why bother playing well? Well, just like any game, the better you do, the better the rewards. I think that by living the best version of my life now, I'm setting myself up for an even better iteration next time around. Kind of like advancing to a level with cooler landscapes and less menacing villains. We're talking about \"life improvement\" through successive playthroughs!\n\nSo, you'll often find me weighing my choices based on how well they'd align with \"playing the game well.\" And it's not just about me; it's about helping my \"co-op players\" level up too. Because, remember, we're all bound by that cosmic glue. The better I play, the better the next iteration for all of us. It's like teaming up in a multi-player game, only the stakes are way higher.\n\nNow, you might say this theory sounds wild, and hey, maybe it is. But it also infuses life with a sense of adventure and possibility. The challenges become quests, the milestones become achievements, and setbacks? Well, they're just plot twists. Plus, there's comfort in thinking that even if we mess up, we'll respawn and get another chance to make things right.\n\nSo, whether you buy into this or not, you've gotta admit it's a fun way to look at life. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some 'leveling up' to do. Who knows what the next iteration has in store? But I'm doing my darn best to make sure it's gonna be epic.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2910, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3a13956-c7df-41cf-9a3b-7ce0853182f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3a13956-c7df-41cf-9a3b-7ce0853182f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_name": "Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4744, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6856ccba-8d51-4a74-aa3a-dcac2305b8ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_name": "Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4744, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "00196dfd562549066bd62029d8a05b4ca0b8507efeca371c8697d878ac250230", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ca3c0ac-0369-4371-8ba9-cf2ad5fa5c54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Reality.txt", "file_name": "Reality.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2932, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "a32dc3800dfa345cd8521a13c1d303a82054e232cce075d11de45ec8121c94ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f169d86e-170e-4ef5-be6f-db846e612a46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "accffb6ba511649c89f3c978c5460f86a0aa4ac8fd1b5c434a63db60f4a97cc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f2cdded3bc380a1e6f71b3c7b349b5ac62b4d961437a000db55cc21ae6ee7b3a", "text": "This is an essay on the current state of my marriage to Denise and frustrations I am experiencing\n\nAs I find myself in the quiet reflection that these therapy sessions afford me, I delve deeper into the complexities of my marriage, unraveling layers of emotions and unmet needs that lie beneath the surface of my most profound frustration: the absence of physical intimacy. My relationship with Denise, my beloved wife, is a tapestry woven with years of love, mutual respect, and shared experiences. We've built a life together, balancing demanding careers, and raising four wonderful children, whose absence in our now too-quiet home is a testament to our life's rapid transitions. Our love is steadfast, a beacon during life's tumultuous storms, but it's within the calm that we've lost a vital connection. For over a decade, the physical bond we once shared has dissipated, leaving a void that words unspoken have shadowed.\n\nDenise is nothing short of extraordinary, a perfectionist to her core, always striving to provide for everyone before herself. Her type \"A\" personality, once a force that intrigued and attracted me, is now a relentless cycle, leaving her perpetually exhausted. This characteristic, coupled with her sense of duty towards her ailing parents, who have become our full-time responsibility, strains her. Though I endeavor to share this load, to be her respite, the undeniable truth is that the circumstances have chiseled away at our intimacy.\n\nOur struggle is not unique, as I've come to understand. Esther Perel, in her seminal work \"Mating in Captivity,\" articulates a concept that resonates with our situation: the dichotomy between the security sought in loving relationships and the sense of adventure crucial to sexual desire. We are entrenched in comfort and predictability, essential for the love we've nurtured but seemingly toxic to our physical connection. It's within this paradox that our sexual estrangement flourishes.\n\nThe impact of this disconnect extends beyond the bedroom. Authoritative literature and research within marital counseling highlight that what we are facing could lead to more significant issues, including infidelity, a breakdown in communication, and a chasm in emotional connectedness. I harbor an intrinsic fear of these silent repercussions, the erosion of the unseen emotional ties binding us.\n\nReflecting on the broader spectrum of marital dynamics, our situation mirrors a distressing norm. Michele Weiner Davis's insights in \"The Sex-Starved Marriage\" depict a reality where one partner feels the chill of sexual indifference, a plight leading to despair and confusion. The reasons are manifold, deeply rooted in emotional contexts, individual psychologies, and, not uncommonly, external familial pressures similar to ours.\n\nConfronting this demands a holistic, empathetic strategy. Communication, as Dr. Sue Johnson advocates in \"Hold Me Tight,\" must transcend superficial dialogues. It necessitates raw emotional honesty, exploring the recesses of our fears, disappointments, and unmet needs. For Denise and me, it means breaking down the barriers erected by routine and rediscovering each other beyond our roles as caregivers and parents.\n\nMoreover, practical lifestyle changes are imperative. We need external support for her parents, allowing Denise mental and physical reprieve. Additionally, prioritizing our relationship is crucial\u2014scheduling regular dates, engaging in activities that unify us, recreating cherished memories, and making new ones to foster emotional closeness.\n\nConsidering a sex therapist or medical consultation is also essential. Biological and physiological changes, especially as we age, can significantly impact libido. A professional might shed light on underlying medical issues or recommend therapy specific to rekindling intimacy. Likewise, couples' retreats focusing on reviving emotional and physical bonds could be transformative.\n\nOn a personal note, introspection is my journey. Recognizing my contributions to our current dynamics, reflecting on possible neglect of her emotional cues, and understanding my emotional landscape are necessary. These realizations could be pivotal in redefining our interactions, contributing to a healthier, more intimate relationship dynamic.\n\nRekindling our physical relationship is more than reigniting sexual passion; it's about reclaiming the intimacy that fortified our union. This journey demands patience, mutual understanding, and proactive steps towards bridging the divide. In the love that has been our life's constant, I find the strength to seek a future where we rediscover the joy of emotional and physical closeness, ensuring our bond remains unbroken and cherished.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f169d86e-170e-4ef5-be6f-db846e612a46": {"__data__": {"id_": "f169d86e-170e-4ef5-be6f-db846e612a46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_name": "Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3296, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c4a35dd-c641-423a-ac5c-0758c2c54036", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_name": "Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3296, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "e940c2df119d9a074dfb61ea57fd9eed0f5fe4d5a5bbf33a3ea72e6d7f4f157f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3a13956-c7df-41cf-9a3b-7ce0853182f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_name": "Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4744, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "f2cdded3bc380a1e6f71b3c7b349b5ac62b4d961437a000db55cc21ae6ee7b3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7d656a3-0507-4023-8792-09fc3d473ad2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e0e7953be4e2fa0e94846dba56f65787ad8b660b399da744691e448c1bcbbc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "accffb6ba511649c89f3c978c5460f86a0aa4ac8fd1b5c434a63db60f4a97cc3", "text": "Fostering a romantic and intimate atmosphere can often enhance your partner's desire and deepen your connection.

This works best when couples agree to go slower, communicate, try different positions within each sexual encounter, and take turns pleasing each other rather than being goal-oriented in their sexual touch. Further, the best way to deal with differences in sex desire is by communicating openly and respectfully about your needs, while being receptive to what your partner\u2019s desires might be. Rather than criticizing your partner, show them what turns you on! \n\nBeing more sensual in your communication with your partner includes talking about how attracted to them you are, how attractive you think he or she is, and what you look forward to during your time alone together. Saying something like \u201cI love it when we cuddle on the sofa and you touch me\u201d can boost your emotional intimacy.  \n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a great idea to focus on sensual touch such as holding hands with your partner, cuddling more often, initiating sex more, and demonstrating your love through physical contact. In fact, touching can release oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and causes a calming sensation. Studies by Julianne Holt-Lundstad of Brigham Young University show that oxytocin is released during sexual orgasm and affectionate touch as well. Physical affection also reduces stress hormones, which lowers daily levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increases a person\u2019s sense of relationship satisfaction. When you have the time, enjoy sharing a massage before sleep!\n\nScheduling at least one date night a week when you don\u2019t focus on work or your family can also help you rekindle passion with your partner because you\u2019re making intimacy a priority.\n\nResponding positively to your partner\u2019s overtures for emotional and sexual connection will help you bring out the best in one another and keep your relationship fulfilling and sexually satisfying. Sex in a good partnership serves its purpose to enhance vitality and satisfaction. Give your partner the gift of love and passion today.

Take heart -- it's natural for partners' sex drives to ebb and flow through the years and things can definitely improve in the bedroom.\n\nBelow, sex therapists share seven pieces of advice that have worked for real couples they've counseled through the years.\n\n1. Don't assume your spouse is uninterested in having sex.\nDon't jump to conclusions about your partner's sex drive without consulting him or her. Take the time to reach out, said New York City-based sex therapist Gracie Landes, pointing to the example of a client who assumed her husband was disinterested in sex based off another therapist's observation.\n\n\"When they came to see me, the husband told us how alienated he felt by this low sex drive diagnosis from afar,\" Landes recalled. \"He said the advice didn't fit him and sex no longer felt safe because he knew it would later be scrutinized.\"\n\nIn the couple's sex therapy sessions, Landes explained that most people are over the honeymoon phase after roughly two years and have to work at an active sex life.\n\n\"Long-term couples need to plan intimacy dates, bringing back that positive anticipation about being together,\" she explained. \"Today, the couple I worked with is having regular sex that works for both of them, that fits their lifestyle and their schedules.\"\n\n2. Acknowledge any resentment you may feel related to intimacy -- then, take turns initiating sex.\nIf you hear \"no, not tonight, honey\" enough times, resentment and shame about your desire is bound to build up -- and that resentment usually bleeds into other areas of your relationship and lives. When this happens, Los Angeles-based sex therapist Moushumi Ghose advises the rejecting partner to recognize that the ball is now in their court to initiate intimacy.\n\nOnce the couple is back in the practice of acknowledging each other's needs, Ghose tells them to take turns initiating sex.\n\n\"When couples do this, it this takes the pressure off the person who is always doing the asking,\" she said.\n\n3. Schedule sex.\nAdd sex to your calendar and consider creating \"sex menus\" based on what you like. \nPHOTODISC VIA GETTY IMAGES\nAdd sex to your calendar and consider creating \"sex menus\" based on what you like.\nYou schedule your kids' playdates, your doctor's appointments and acupuncture visits. For couples stuck in passionless marriages, New York City-based sex therapist Michael Aaron advises them to schedule in sex as well.\n\n\"This includes not only blocking time, but planning out all of the details,\" he explained. \"Creating quality experiences requires foresight and planning, right down to negotiating specific sex acts. I often have couples create sex menus that they can choose from, based on interests. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that people want to do more of what feels good.\"\n\n4. Talk about your fantasies.\nToo often, people in long-term relationships keep their latest sexual fantasies and interests to themselves, said Ghose.\n\n\"It's typically beyond what they want in bed,\" she said. \"This goes a little deeper and requires self disclosure, for example, expressing a desire for being dominated or maybe they prefer a submissive role. I tell couples to have a heart-to-heart with each other. Sharing their secret fantasies and fetishes helps in the bedroom but it also builds a stronger sense of connection, which fosters deeper intimacy.\"\n\n5. Learn to work around any sexual dysfunction.\nSexual dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or a lack of vaginal lubrication) often makes partners apprehensive about initiating sex, said Laurel Steinberg, a psychotherapist based in Great Neck, New York.\n\n\"They fear having lackluster sexual experiences or letting their partners down,\" she explained. \"Couples simply need to change their mindset and be OK with the fact that the body doesn\u2019t always perform as the mind wishes it did.\"\n\nSteinberg said it's also helpful for couples to widen their definition of quality sex.\n\n\"Couples need to realize that there are an infinite variety of ways to delight a partner that don't depend on an erect penis or vaginal penetration,\" she said. \"When all types of sexual touch are viewed to be as equally valuable, couples can switch gears and find another trick up their sleeves.\"\n\n6.

Here\u2019s why\u2014and how.\nfitness over 60\nLooking for a fountain of youth? Just look for your sneakers. Then lace them up and get moving.\n\nExercise can turn back the clock, jumpstart your energy, and restore your health.\n\nThat\u2019s the message we heard over and over when we asked the SilverSneakers Facebook community for a dose of fitness inspiration. Some said they didn\u2019t start exercising until they were well into their 60s, but a desire to thrive in their retirement years sparked their interest.\n\nOthers fell out of the fitness habit during the hustle and bustle of raising families and building careers in midlife. Often, a health scare is what lit the fire to move more.\n\nWhatever the reason, this group is clearly on to something. Physical activity is key to a happier, healthier life for older adults, according to 2020 research published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\n\nThose findings are backed up by reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which boasts that exercise is good for your heart, muscles, bones, brain and emotional well-being.\n\nStaying physically active as you get older helps protect against some of the biggest health problems older adults face, including:\n\nHeart disease\nStroke\nDiabetes\nFalls\nDaily physical activity has also been shown to help ward off dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, reports the CDC. In fact, one study showed that cognitive decline is almost twice as common among adults who aren\u2019t active compared to those who are.\n\nGet and stay active with SilverSneakers! Classes and events are happening right now at participating gyms, online through SilverSneakers LIVE, and at community centers near you. Activate your free online account to get started.\n\nAs for that fountain of youth? Getting at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week has been linked to a 20% lower risk of early death from any cause, according to a 2022 report from the American Heart Association.\n\nBut even small amounts of activity \u2014 five to 10 minutes, if that\u2019s what you can manage \u2014 can help your health. In other words, exercise won\u2019t make you live forever, but it could help you live longer and better.\n\nHere, SilverSneakers community members share the steps they\u2019ve taken to prioritize their fitness, no matter how many birthdays they\u2019ve celebrated.\n\nStep #1: Start Small\nMaybe you haven\u2019t played sports since high school, or maybe you\u2019ve never exercised before. That\u2019s okay. Starting small is good, and just starting is even better.\n\nJust ask Lori H., who started SilverSneakers classes after she retired at 68. Now in her mid-70s, she says, \u201cI am in the best shape of my life. I can do over 12 pushups from the floor and hold the plank for 90 seconds. My clothes fit better, and I have the energy now to hike in North Carolina with my husband.\u201d\n\nLori finds inspiration among her fellow exercisers. She points out, \u201cThere are ladies in my class who are in their late 80s and two who are 90.\u201d\n\nStep #2: Find a Workout Partner\nIdeally, recruit someone around your own age. Seniors stick to their fitness routines best when they work out together, science says.\n\nIn fact, older adults who participated in a fitness program with others in their age group were three times more likely to come to exercise classes, according to researchers from the University of British Columbia.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of camaraderie that keeps Linda J. showing up for workouts.\n\n\u201cI started in my 60s after being diagnosed with diabetes,\u201d she says. \u201cI go to a senior center, and I love the group \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t do it at home on my own!\u201d\n\nStep #3: Ignore Your Excuses\nIt may be great to have a friend to exercise with, but if you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t be nervous. Take a deep breath and do it anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for your spouse or buddy to get started,\u201d says Susan S., who started yoga at 60 and SilverSneakers classes at 67.\n\n\u201cIf I had waited for those folks, I\u2019d still be waiting \u2014 and 22 pounds heavier,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be your own advocate and care about yourself and your well-being. You deserve to feel good!\u201d\n\nPlus, you never know \u2014 you could meet your new best friend. \u201cI\u2019ve met some wonderful, interesting, fun folks,\u201d Susan says.\n\nAnd those new friends come with health benefits.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42cd4bd3-5eae-4e0c-b159-9e8fcee4469c": {"__data__": {"id_": "42cd4bd3-5eae-4e0c-b159-9e8fcee4469c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05434a84-88e1-4747-a662-0d4dc5b66b03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "6bd86a59a3bf34324316c9df1c14c4dadda1fc33860de76a63b715649e54ecc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61c1c19f-9790-41b6-9f9f-cce845ea5d11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_name": "6 steps to aging fitness.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7152, "creation_date": "2023-12-26", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "7f5f6bb0d4eb932472b5d495430333f5c012c0a263ce389c5d0184e2f564e358", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a5b9c3326835e6d072b8c95aa0ba3f6830fec8fa9f5ab5af6171655facc4af5", "text": "\u201cI go to a senior center, and I love the group \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t do it at home on my own!\u201d\n\nStep #3: Ignore Your Excuses\nIt may be great to have a friend to exercise with, but if you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t be nervous.

Social isolation is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes per day, according to Brigham Young University researchers. Maintaining strong relationships can improve your health and quality of life.\n\nStep #4: Embrace New Experiences\nIn her 60s, Bunny D. was an exercise newbie. \u201cI\u2019d never been active,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I moved in to take care of my mom, and I need to be strong to care for her.\u201d\n\nBunny started with a SilverSneakers water aerobics class and soon added walking. Things really took off from there.\n\nShe\u2019s even walked-jogged two 5Ks, she says. In one race, she finished first in her age group. And in the other, second.\n\nYour body isn\u2019t the only thing that will benefit from new challenges. Learning and trying new things keeps the brain healthy and cuts your risk of dementia.\n\nStep #5: Make It a Habit\nRobin H. was always active \u2014 bicycling, gardening, riding horses \u2014 but she never went to the gym. That changed after surviving cancer and recovering from a heart attack in her early 60s.\n\n\u201cI turned into a gym rat,\u201d she says. At first, her workout schedule was tough. \u201cBut it became the backbone of my life. It gave my life order, purpose, and a challenge.\u201d\n\nNow in her 70s, Robin exercises three to four times a week. \u201cWhat keeps me going is how good I feel physically and how much I enjoy the accomplishment. Exercise is a part of my life now, and I feel privileged every time I go to the gym.\u201d\n\nStep #6: Start Again If You Need To\nIf you grew up very active but put exercise on the back burner in your 30s or 40s because \u201clife got in the way and work took too much time,\u201d Susan B. understands completely.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I knew, I was 59 and had a double mastectomy,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so depressed. I was using a cane, was very overweight, and wouldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror.\u201d\n\nBut Susan\u2019s story doesn\u2019t end there. \u201cI realized I was not going to live long the way I was going,\u201d she says.\n\nShe joined a senior activity center. \u201cI met so many people like me. We encourage each other and support each other,\u201d she says.\n\nBy her late 60s, Susan was walking a couple of miles at a time without a cane. She also goes to a chair yoga class three days a week, and has learned to use fitness equipment at her gym. She\u2019s even taking fewer pain medications.\n\nMore than that, she has a positive outlook on life. \u201cI\u2019m happier, and I know I have many more happy days to come.\u201d\n\nHer top tip? \u201cGet up and tell yourself you are worth it \u2014 then go have fun!\u201d", "start_char_idx": 3694, "end_char_idx": 6906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1eae691a-e3b1-4cf4-b272-bbe534cfc452": {"__data__": {"id_": "1eae691a-e3b1-4cf4-b272-bbe534cfc452", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Age_Gap.txt", "file_name": "Age_Gap.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2911, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "487ace14-51c4-44b3-a5f4-1129a905b871", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Age_Gap.txt", "file_name": "Age_Gap.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2911, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "d0552fa3381a6fc3363bdc145f27e2c5080b81aa7d57d2e03b77fdead52210ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "040efd513d0c6edc9e144987b922c5f97fc2f50ea880b6819f632d73b7b39f13", "text": "These are the frustrations I experience as a mature man working wih 20 and 30 somethings\n\nMan, lemme tell you, working in tech at 62 is like being a classic rock song in a playlist full of EDM hits. You're not everyone's go-to, but you've got your own charm. I might not have grown up with smartphones glued to my hand, but I've got this whole \"wise elder\" vibe going, you know?\n\nThe joys are real. The young guns around me are just brimming with energy and fresh ideas. It's like being around a bunch of Teslas while I'm the trusty ol' pickup truck. And you bet that gives me a kind of exhilarating energy boost. Every time I see them tackle problems and come up with innovative solutions, it makes me feel like I'm a part of something groundbreaking, like I'm still \"in the game\" so to speak.\n\nBut oh boy, the frustrations? Cue the dramatic music. See, I'm a social animal, always have been. Give me a good joke, and I'll give you a belly laugh you won't forget. But despite my charming personality (if I do say so myself) and my best attempts at humor, I just can't seem to bridge that generational gap.\n\nIt's like they're speaking a different language sometimes. They talk in memes, GIFs, and references to shows that\u2014no kidding\u2014I've never heard of. And don't get me started on their social media lingo. \"Hey, did you see that tweet from so-and-so? Totally went viral!\" Uh, sure, but when I was your age, \"going viral\" was something you wanted to avoid.\n\nWhat really stings is the after-work hangouts. They'll huddle up, making plans for drinks or some weekend escapade, and I'm just standing there like a decoration, usually left out of the invite. Ouch. I've tried to initiate outings myself, even learned how to create a \"group chat,\" but the response is always lukewarm. I end up feeling like that kid in school who throws a party but nobody shows up. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like they're outright ignoring me. We'll have short conversations, and they'll politely laugh at my jokes\u2014especially the dad jokes, go figure\u2014but it doesn't go beyond that. It's like we're on two different frequencies and can't quite tune into each other.\n\nSo what's a 62-year-old guy to do? I've considered going full-on \"cool grandpa\" mode: rocking some trendier outfits, maybe getting a hipster haircut. But who am I kidding? That's not me. Instead, I'm focusing on what I can bring to the table: experience, wisdom, and a killer playlist of classic rock songs.\n\nI might not be in the \"in-crowd,\" but I've got my own flavor of cool. And who knows, maybe one day these young whipper-snappers will realize that a little classic rock mixes pretty well with EDM. Until then, I'll keep strumming my own tune, enjoying the ride and dealing with the bumps in the road.

Before you continue here, if you haven't already, make sure you have your Neon SDK installed and have PyCharm installed as well. I'll link the two videos for those below. Let's get started.\n\nSkill Intro\nOkay, so we're going to make a new skill for Neon today and we're just going to make a launcher skill. So, a skill where you can say 'launch a program', and it will launch that program.\n\nAVMusic Skill Example\nTo start we're going to look at AV Music here. So, this is just an example of a skill we have that uses the Adapt intent builder and if we scroll down, there are some aspects of every skill that look very much the same. They're all going to be a subset of Mycroft skill and we're going to have this init function and also I'm going to have this initialize function where we register our intents.\n\nSkill File Structure\nSo, if we look over in our folder structure, I've already made a launcher skill outline, kind of. We have the folder for the skill, our dialog and vocab sub-directories, both with US English is the only language in there, and then we have our init file.\n\nWriting our Skill Intent If I pull that up, it's so far empty, so we're going to fill that in. Since this is a launcher skill, we need to be able to launch programs; to do that we're going to use subprocess, which is a module that basically lets you run a command as you would run it in a terminal. We're also going to use Adapt as I mentioned previously, so we're going to need to import the intent builder there. This is a skill so we need to import the parent skill; so from mycroft.skills.core import mycroft skill, and then lastly, I always import our log, especially when you're creating something new or making changes. It's good to put log statements around things to see where something failed if it fails. Alright so we're going to do class launcher skill, and that is a Mycroft skill, and then our init. We're not initializing any variables so we are only going to have this one line under our init and this is just following convention of mycroft skills. And then we're going to make our initialize function, and this is where we register our intents. All right, so let's look at take a look at what I just typed up here. So, we're defining this launch chromium intent using the intent builder we imported from Adapt. We're naming that intent launch chromium intent, and we told it it's going to require a launch keyword and it's going to require a chromium keyword, and then we told it to build. So this is a pretty common formula you'll see, we'll get into that with some variations a little bit later. So now what we need to do is we need to actually register that intent to something. So we need to tell it when it matches what it's going to do. And this is all just following convention, this self dot launch chromium intent is a function we're going to write here in just a moment. It's just convention that this defined name matches this defined name, so it's not like we're calling something recursively. They just match the names for convention's sake.\n\nWriting our Skill Function\nAnd we're going to pass it this message parameter. Message is an object that contains things like what you actually said and what these key words are that it found. So, for debugging, I always like to just log message.data. This can help if you are trying to pull a lot of key words out of something, or you just want to see what keywords you found; some other stuff like that. It's always good to put a self.speak under any intent match. That just means that Neon will say something when it matches. You could leave this out, and just have it call up a program, but it makes a lot more sense to have it say something, so you know why that program launched for example. I'm going to use sub-process here to launch chromium and then you give it a parameter of a website to go to. And then if we look here, we have a warning that we're not implementing all of our abstract methods.\n\n'stop' Abstract Method\nI'm just going to pop over to the Mycroft skill, and I know which method this is, so I'm just going to search for it. So, stop is an abstract method that every skill should implement.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4283, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5074b01-d443-438a-8769-be747ad20d58": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5074b01-d443-438a-8769-be747ad20d58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "426d81cd-0db5-4d47-b7f9-11a54f4ff40b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "3595586828146c83f65701048c3cd09efba443c1711912ede7254f7623b2ad9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d97d4b12-de2e-42fb-a547-1c47e865294f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "35d8dd9ffae74d17ca769aa5cedd603ef76641e676030563bfca2f76fc3494ed", "text": "It's always good to put a self.speak under any intent match.

I'm going to use sub-process here to launch chromium and then you give it a parameter of a website to go to. And then if we look here, we have a warning that we're not implementing all of our abstract methods.\n\n'stop' Abstract Method\nI'm just going to pop over to the Mycroft skill, and I know which method this is, so I'm just going to search for it. So, stop is an abstract method that every skill should implement. From this particular skill, we don't have any processes that we would need to explicitly stop, so it's just going to pass. But say you had something like AV Music, if I go back to our example there. It has stop and what it has to do is it has to for example disable the pause intent, because if it's not playing anything, there's nothing to pause and it also has to kill the process-- so the-- in this case, MPV, which is playing the audio and video.\n\nFinishing Up Our Skill init\nFor this skill, we just want it to launch the program. We don't want it to track it, we don't want it to have to close it at a later time; it's just going to launch it and then be done. And then the last part we have to add here is our create skill method, and all that's going to do is return our class. And that is our completed skill init, now I'm going to look at our keywords here. We have a launch keyword and we have a chromium keyword, so those need to be added.\n\nCreating .voc Files\nIf we go over to our vocab directory and then we made our en-us. I'm going to make a new file here, and this is going to be the same string I used here in require, with the file extension .voc. We'll add that and then this file, basically one per line, we're going to add what words mean launch. So for this example I'm going to say launch and I'm going to say open. So, either launch or open will fulfill this requirement and then we're going to do the same thing for chromium. Add that to our git, and for chromium I'll just say chromium, also Chrome, or browser; and I think that makes sense. So as long as we have one word from our launch keyword and one word from our chromium keyword, this function will be called. So now I'm going to commit these changes, and we'll give it a test.\n\nTesting our Skill Okay, so we have pulled our changes on our test machine here, so now we're going to test our new skill just by saying launch Chrome. (launching Chrome) And it works. (welcome to neongecko.com, thanks for being a developer. While you're here, make sure to check out some of our information on our neon SDK or maybe check out our Klat adaptive forums, which also integrate our neon AI.)\n\nAdding Functionality (More Programs)\nSo, now that we know our skill works, we're going to make some additions to make it a little more useful. Instead of just launching Chrome we're going to add some options for other programs. So if I want to add our file explorer as an option, I'm going to need to make a new keyword. So I'll add NautilusKeyword.voc. Nautilus is Ubuntu's file explorer. I'll go ahead and add nautilus, files, file explorer. And now for our intent, we're going to modify this. We don't want to require the chromium keyword now, since we're adding another option, so we're going to change this to optionally and then we're going to add also optionally Nautilus.\n\nModifying our Launcher Function\nSo, we have those changes, now we need to change our intent, and this isn't really chromium anymore, so I'm going to refactor this and just name it launch program intent. And same with our function. Perfect. So, that looks better and then we'll add this if message.data.get ChromiumKeyword, then we'll launch Chrome. I'm just going to copy this and just change this to Nautilus, and now we have the same thing for our file browser. I'm going to add one more for our terminal in the same way. We'll add another optionally here and we'll do another copy and paste.", "start_char_idx": 3574, "end_char_idx": 7725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d97d4b12-de2e-42fb-a547-1c47e865294f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d97d4b12-de2e-42fb-a547-1c47e865294f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5074b01-d443-438a-8769-be747ad20d58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "35d8dd9ffae74d17ca769aa5cedd603ef76641e676030563bfca2f76fc3494ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b3f5d8c-14c8-49a2-b254-96cc02fc117e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af081c392e0efc5e544569295462b49b0c32aa7836011420d4cd8e33c5127c4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "text": "And now for our intent, we're going to modify this.

We'll add another optionally here and we'll do another copy and paste. So that's going to be an else if.\n\nUsing Dialog Files for Speech\nSo now what we're going to do, is we're going to change the way we handle the speaking. Since these are all very similar we're basically just going to say launching, and then the name of the program we're launching. We can use a dialog file to make that a little simpler. So to do that, instead of speaking for each one, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this variable program. I'm going to start that out as None and then, depending on the program we match, I'm going to assign a value. And then at the very end of this, I'm going to say if program self.speak dialog launch program and feed it this dictionary that has key program, with value whatever this variable evaluates to. And then I'm going to put in this else statement let's get self.peak I don't know that program.\n\nAnalyzing Our Skill Logic\nSo let's look at how this will work. Our intent builder is going to require launch that's the only requirement here, so if it hears the word launch or open, the two that we put in our vocab file, then its going to call this intent. Once it gets here, it's going to look for chromium or chromium key word in the message. If it doesn't find that it'll look for a nautilus one. If it doesn't find that in to look for terminal. If it doesn't find that, it's still going to continue here. But since we started program out as none, unless it matches one of these three, program is going to have a value of none, so we'll get this message of \"I don't know that program.\" If it does match one of these, then it's going to speak this dialogue, and we need to tell it what this dialogue is.\n\nAdding Another Dialog File\nSo, if we go back over to our dialogue directory, and under language. And we name it with this string we used here .dialog. text, and to our git. And then I'm just going to type in launching {{program}}. So, any of these values in these double curly braces, it's going to look for in the dictionary we pass it.\n\nRunning More Tests So I'm going to minimize this, and I have Neon running here I just have the mic muted here, so we're going to unmute the mic and give it a test. Launch Chrome. (launching Chrome) And we get exactly what we expect. So if we want to do some further testing, since we have skip Wake words enabled here ,it should be transcribing everything I'm saying. So if I were to without pausing say launch Chrome it should still launch Chrome. And it did. And another important part of testing here is to test things that we wouldn't expect to match to make sure we get an expected result. So, an example would be if I were to just say launch. And it were to transcribe correctly as launch. (I don't know that program). We get the response we expected, because it went through that else where program was none and it just said it doesn't know that program. And then the other case that we talked about, if I were to say launch chromium and File Explorer (launching Chrome) it's only going to match the first one in that statement which means the order I said it didn't really matter. I could just as easily say launch file explorer and chromium, and it could transcribe correctly. Launch file explorer and chromium. (launching Chrome) and it still launches chrome because that's the first one it looks for.", "start_char_idx": 6894, "end_char_idx": 11035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b3f5d8c-14c8-49a2-b254-96cc02fc117e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b3f5d8c-14c8-49a2-b254-96cc02fc117e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bf56423-fba4-4217-a2bd-d90927adbdbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "103bb74f6c037a86b0bdf2cdeb7c0d86d6c8632f04736e23e6de6024d771e928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d97d4b12-de2e-42fb-a547-1c47e865294f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_name": "Buil Neon Skill Part 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12386, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "4ea22c8a654b333c0fff64701fdfaa2cd4c1dab2fc341f4ce0cc64a9b442b4df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "af081c392e0efc5e544569295462b49b0c32aa7836011420d4cd8e33c5127c4b", "text": "And it did.

(launching Chrome) and it still launches chrome because that's the first one it looks for.\n\nHandling Imperfect Transcriptions\nBut this brings up another point of Google transcription isn't perfect, and launch and lunch seem to be fairly similar words it's going to match. So what I can do to improve our success rate with the skill is to go back to our vocab file and I can just add lunch as one of our words there, and this may not make a lot of sense looking at it, but when you look at some of the quirks of the transcriptions, this is a useful way to make it a little more reliable.\n\nTesting with Wake Words Enabled\nSo with that testing done, I'm just going to quickly turn wake words back on and make sure we get expected behavior in that mode. We didn't do anything in the skill that was explicitly dependent on wake words, so this shouldn't make a difference but it's still good to test.\n\nHey Neon, launch file explorer (launching file explorer)\n\nHey Neon, launch terminal (launching terminal)\n\nHey Neon, launch. (I don't know that program)\n\nAnd we get the same behavior that we would expect, matching what happened when we were skipping wake words.\n\nThanks for watching this Neon AI tutorial.

Let's get started. PYTHON REGEX\n\nReview and Overview\nSo in the last video, we tested our launcher skill. We had it set up to launch one of four programs, depending on what we said, and now we're going to look at that and think about what would happen as we started adding programs to this list. So right now, we just have our intent that requires a launch keyword and then optionally any of the other program keywords that we manually input. And then based on that, it's going to launch one of those programs. But if we add -- as we add more programs, that can get a little bit cumbersome, so we're going to look at using regular expressions to filter out a program name from a message, without telling it what the options of that name are.\n\nCreating a Regex File So to do that we have our regex directory inside of our skill, and then our language underneath that, similar to our vocab and dialogue. And this one I've named program.rx, and what we're going to do with that is if we look at our launch keywords, I'm going to say one of those -- any of those -- so launch, lunch, or open, and then the word that follows that is our program. And this follows the Python conventions for regular expressions, I'll put a link to that in the description here. But what this means, it's going to look for one of these three words and then whatever comes next is going to be our program.\n\nAdding to Skill init and Modifying Intents\nSo looking back at our init file, we'll see there are some changes. We've moved our options for each program into our init. So instead of the .voc files we had before, now we just have these lists of words that match for each program, and we've actually removed the .voc files that we are previously using. Our intent builder also looks a little different accordingly. So we still have required our launch keyword, and now we also have required a program, which it gets from our regex file we just looked at, and then we also have this optionally Neon, which we'll take a look at in a moment. But what this means now is it needs to see you say \"launch something\" or \"Neon launch something\" before it activates. So the word launch should no longer just call this skill.\n\nHandling False Positives\nSo moving into our intent, we added this if statement, and if we look at this, we're saying: if we are skipping wake words and we have Neon in our message, then we'll continue. Or if we are not skipping wake words then we will continue. So you'll see this in a number of skills, it's useful to cut down on the number of false activations, especially a word like launch or lunch will quite probably come up in everyday conversation, and this way you won't have Neon interrupting and saying \"I couldn't find that\", every time it hears launch or lunch. So for this to work we've added our Neon.voc file here next to our launch keyword. If we take a look at that it basically just contains neon and then some other common transcriptions, similar to how we have lunch in our launch one.\n\nChanges to Our Function\nSo looking back at our function here, we've changed this around so program is now getting extracted from the message data, whereas before we were assigning it based on some other words in our message data. So now we've changed the logic to: we assume we have a match, we go through, and if we get one of the programs out of the list that we defined earlier, then we launch that program in the same way. So if Chrome then Chrome, else if Nautilus then Nautilus, terminal, Text Edit, etc. and then we've added this else, so if the program wasn't in any of these lists, then we say we did not find a match. If we did find a match, we speak dialogue the same way we did previously, and now if we don't find a match, we instead of using the speak statement we were before, we have another dialogue. If we look at that dialogue, file it's going to tell us \"I could not find a program named\", and then whatever program it heard. So, this is nice because you get a more specific response.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4243, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8158b35-5777-4b55-a355-0c579b188377": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8158b35-5777-4b55-a355-0c579b188377", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e26a92-4948-4b20-a7a5-9671204d82bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "ba60abda17a9aa0058cdeb29d2894fc8619f1190e00e8c9b9729df7f3a670fb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c939402-4855-493f-b081-4f7a574605e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_name": "Build Neon Skill Part 2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5939, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "f087064968216d7886c1b4517f3a7c13d2ba67777277fe11a9a5dfb654b90bdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2730f426fd878aecc4ed3967a63002b37e23f5785b7d3a05cc671bc4e8788e90", "text": "So now we've changed the logic to: we assume we have a match, we go through, and if we get one of the programs out of the list that we defined earlier, then we launch that program in the same way.

If we look at that dialogue, file it's going to tell us \"I could not find a program named\", and then whatever program it heard. So, this is nice because you get a more specific response. Also, you'll find maybe a program that should have matched, kind of like how we had launch and lunch earlier, and it'll tell you what it heard, and you can say okay that should be added to one of these lists. So with that we're going to give this a test.\n\nTesting our Changes Okay so now let's give those changes a test. If I were to say launch Chrome, we shouldn't have anything happen because we're skipping Wake words, and I didn't say our keyword. If I say neon launch Chrome, (launching Chrome) then we get Chrome as we would expect. So I'm just gonna close that and go ahead and enable our wake words, so we can give that a try. So now if I say hey neon, launch Nautilus (launching Nautilus) we get our file explorer and even if I say hey Neon, Neon launch File Explorer (launching File Explorer) it'll still launch the file explorer. So, regardless of the Neon in front when we have wake words enabled, it will do- it will still parse out whatever is after our keyword. So, I'll close that out and then try something we don't have. Hey Neon, launch Neon (sorry I could not find neon) and that's exactly what we expected.\n\nSummary and Closing\nSo that's an example of how you can use a regex file to simplify some of your intent building, and also how to get some more data out of the messages. So in the next video, we're going to look at instead of using Adapt, moving to Padatious and that will simplify things a little bit more here as well. Thanks for watching this Neon AI tutorial.

Title:You're Not Lazy: How to Live a Chaotically Organised Life  Content: [Music] if you are picking a brain and one listens to everything you try to do works according to plans sticks the schedules is obedient and calm and the second is a hellscape of chaos and obsession lacks all sense of structure organization just love staying up until 3am overthinking every night i mean you'd pick the first one right everything seems to be built for type 1 brains in a world full of success stories based on consistency atomic habits and self-disciplined routine it can seem impossible to succeed withoutjust that and so for the longest time all i've wanted was a different brain one that would actually listen to me because as someone who has never been able to create any sense of long-term structure if you can relate to me at all here is how i think we can end up right where our consistent habit-forming friends are without ever needing to be consistent or create habits because even though on the outside i realize it looks as though i'm an organized person i run this youtube channel by myself i have apodcast and jobs and school but the thing is on the inside it's probably not what you think it is so let's just get straight into it i'm going to start my case against consistency and habit formation using my younger self as an example because i feel that she had a much better grasp on how to organize myself so i'm going to get a slight cringe pass here but when i was younger i was very good academically at the end of the year i would always have the best grades i would win olympiads i would getall types of reward for excellent academic achievement so you would presumably think that i was a very organized and well put together student and this is not the case on any given day of the year if you were to zoom in chances are i had forgotten what subjects i had that day i might have left my homework at home or had never done my homework because i'd forgotten to do it or sometimes very cheekily i just didn't want to do it and so i very often kind of fell behind during the year but this was completely normal tome i always recognized that sometimes i didn't feel like doing something so i fell behind and then i got interested in it so i caught up and then i got very interested in it so i went ahead and this fall behind catch up and go ahead schedule was very natural to me very often on the same day that i was behind on something that night i would study the next three months of that subject that we hadn't even done yet so i would go ahead everyone else i was just using my passion when i wanted to do things and one of the most important things i'dhad to reteach myself as an adult is that falling behind is not quitting it's just a third of the story because i feel as though when i got older and i got used to seeing everyone being super consistent and having these habits as soon as i didn't do something for a while i thought that i had quit and that i'm just not as good as everyone else at this thing and it's not right for me when this is not the full story being a chaos and passion driven person falling behind is just a third of the storysometimes i don't do things but it's guaranteed that if i genuinely want to do them i will catch up and go ahead much later and this has been such an important thing for me to relearn i generally believe that consistency is not for everyone and those of us who cannot adapt it end up quitting so many things just because we think that we can't be consistent and therefore we cannot do it i know it's not the best thing in the world but sometimes i go to gym five times a week for a few months in a row and sometimes i won't go to thegym at all for five months but i know that this doesn't mean that i hate exercising because i'm going to want to do it again and i'm going to catch up on the progress that i missed out on during that time when i genuinely didn't feel like doing it just because i stopped does not mean that i have quit something forever douglas adams has a quote that i really relate to when he says that i love deadlines i love the wishing noise they make as they go by and this is so relatable for me any sort of artificialdeadlines are just not serious enough for me to use and therefore even though that i know that there are some", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx":

because we think that we can't be consistent and therefore we cannot do it i know it's not the best thing in the world but sometimes i go to gym five times a week for a few months in a row and sometimes i won't go to thegym at all for five months but i know that this doesn't mean that i hate exercising because i'm going to want to do it again and i'm going to catch up on the progress that i missed out on during that time when i genuinely didn't feel like doing it just because i stopped does not mean that i have quit something forever douglas adams has a quote that i really relate to when he says that i love deadlines i love the wishing noise they make as they go by and this is so relatable for me any sort of artificialdeadlines are just not serious enough for me to use and therefore even though that i know that there are some harsh deadlines in life for example when i was younger i had end of your exams now as an adult i need to hand projects in i have other things that i need to do for work but in between now and then i do not create any real deadlines anything that i put in my calendar is a suggestion it's not something that i need to do it's more like if i feel like it i might do this today but just because i skip it one two three fourfive six times in a row does that mean that i cannot catch up on this thing later or that i'm not good at this thing at all i only treat real deadlines like deadlines all the arbitrary ones are suggestions and i don't create any sort of self-hate or hatred for the thing that i'm doing around them now i'm very comfortable never being a consistent habit farming girl but always being a full-behind catch-up and go ahead girl because just like it used to do well for me academically when i was younger ithonestly does really well for me in life right now because it's just the way i work and this leads me very comfortably onto what's perhaps a very controversial point which is screw one percent improvements i love james clear his book atomic habits is really really good but it genuinely has caused me a lot of damage because when i saw his one percent improvement graphs which is basically the thought that if you keep improving at something just one percent every single day by the end of the year you will be exponentially better at thisthing which is really really true it's a hundred percent true so i looked at this graph and my heart just sank because i realized i could never do this i could never do something consistently for a year because the best way to get me to hate something or to quit something is to make a strict schedule for it if you tell me elizabeth you need to do this thing three times a week for the next two months there's no chance i'm just going to leave it and so i realized that it's never going to work because onepercent improvements only work if you do things very consistently if you do things three times a month and you improve one percent every time you're getting absolutely nowhere and even worse if you do things twice a year and you improve only one percent at them that's no improvement you're going to stop doing these things because as frederick hesburgh in the harvard business review identified something that we probably all know intuitively of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress whichbasically means the better we get at something the more we want to do it and this one percent improvements only works if you're consistent and so i'm stuck in this conundrum where i have to be consistent in order to improve and so i can never improve or want to do everything and i'm always stuck with low level motivation for everything in my life this is where my method comes in basically what i've decided is to completely screw the one percent improvement and go for five percent 500 5000 improvements every single time andgenuinely this is how i've learned my skills this is how i've learned to draw to paint to edit and everything so i'm going to explain how i do this specifically if you are also a chaotic passionate person hopefully this might work for you a few years ago i wanted to learn 3d animation because i saw people who create the video game characters and stuff and i thought oh my god this looks so cool i want to learn how to do it the way to quit this for me is to go okay so twice a week for the next six months i'mgoing to slowly learn how to 3d anime no no this would never work what i do instead is that i do nothing but i just passively kind of look at animations here and there so whenever i'm procrastinating or i have some free time i'll just go through my phone and i'll look at really good 3d animated work and what i'm doing here is that i'm", "start_char_idx": 3840, "end_char_idx": 8620, "text_template":

whenever i'm procrastinating or i have some free time i'll just go through my phone and i'll look at really good 3d animated work and what i'm doing here is that i'm passively priming my brain to get passionate about this thing and to fall in love with this thing and i'm not allowing myself to start the work because i'm just doing this thing slowlyand slowly and slowly and at some points i'll reach a tipping point while i go straight i need to learn this right now because i can't wait to learn this so then i'll just sit down and honestly i had never done any work before in my life i sat down and i sat for maybe 10 to 15 hours on my laptop and i taught myself from nothing to be basically quite good at learning to animate and then on the second day i created this and i'll show it on screen on the third day i was really good i created this soin three days i learned something that admittedly i could have pieced myself and done for a very long time if i was different i just can't do things that way so i went for like 10 000 improvements basically in the space of three days which otherwise i would have never been able to achieve because if i would have tried to get to one percent improvement i would have quit very very early on so this is how i learn skills without creating habits i prime myself for extreme passion and then i get to do them and also another huge benefit ofthis is that you get to learn things so much faster and with so much more focus because as much as i envy and i'm so jealous of consistent and organized people because they can do so many things the one thing that i think i'm a lot better at is deep work i don't understand why people struggle with deep work i'm always falling into deep work and i think it's because they pace themselves too much and they create these short schedules or i'm only going to do this for 40 minutes a day if yousit into it if you get in the proper mood to want to do something properly you can get extreme levels of focus and therefore crazy results and because for my personal projects and things that i want to work on i only work in a deep work state i can get so much more done and learn a lot faster and therefore i'm leveraging huge amounts of passion huge amounts of focus the best kind of state of mind for learning to get extreme results really really fast without one percent improvements so yeah this is how i hack my brain into learning things nowi'm pretty sure a lot of you might be thinking this really doesn't work for everything and you would be 100 right i think the toughest pill for me to swallow especially as a competitive person is the realization that there are certain things in life that i will just never be good at i know this is hard to say for me but it's it's just true i will never be good at memorizing facts because you need to repeat things again and again in order to remember them consistently it's not for me i loveexercise but i will never be a bodybuilder because it takes ridiculous amounts of food restriction and exercise for a long amount of time to get somewhere and i can absolutely never do that but this doesn't mean that i can't learn some things or that i can't enjoy exercise so i think that in my life i do not optimize for consistency i optimize for passion because even though there are some things that i'm always going to be really bad at there are some things that i'm always very very good at i canget inhumane amounts of work done in a short burst of time i can learn huge amounts of information in short periods of time and also i have a very creative bigger picture mind because i touch things intensively and then i leave them for a very long time so when i come back to them i can see things differently so i am very good at bigger picture

being a passionate person because that's where i can shine there's this very interesting study that showed that 50 of the amount of work done in a company is done by the top 10 of workers and also the best performer is a hundred times more productive than the lowest performer in the company and this doesn't mean that we should all aim to be the most productive person butbasically what that means is that these people who are at the top are probably having a lot more fun and also just in their natural element so i think recognizing my strengths recognizing the things that i'm good at and optimizing for those as much as i can leads to better results in my life and also just letting go of the things that are just too painful and impossible for me to do because trust me i've tried and it does not work as a slight caveat here of course i do not mean that i lead my life just based on my feelings and passionsand some level of strictness and rigorousness and routine is absolutely necessary to function in the world especially with meetings and jobs so i can do these things i'm just not the best at them and so even though there's these strict schedules when it comes to the work

I swear, it's like an impulse I can't control. I'm that guy, the one who finds a shortcut or a new piece of software and just has to share it with the team. You know, because if it blew my mind, it's gotta rock theirs too, right?\n\nEvery time I find a way to make our workflow more efficient or discover a tech hack that's nothing short of miraculous, I feel like a kid who's just found a hidden treasure. I can't help but shout, \"Eureka!\"\u2014well, not literally, but you get the picture. I draft the email, create the presentation, or seize the moment at team meetings to unveil my latest tech marvel. \"This,\" I think, \"is gonna change everything!\"\n\nThe reactions are always encouraging at first. Eyes widen, people nod, there are a few \"wow\"s and \"that's cool\"s sprinkled in. But that's where it ends. Nobody adopts the new method. No follow-up questions. It's like I've shown them a magic trick and they applaud, but no one wants to learn how it's done. Talk about an anticlimax.\n\nAnd that's the kicker. I can't shake this feeling that if I just kept my mouth shut and let someone stumble upon my genius organically, they might actually take an interest. Like, if they discovered it in the wild, in the course of our work, it would have that \"found treasure\" allure. But my impulses get the best of me, and I can't help but speed up the reveal.\n\nIt's frustrating, you know? Here I am, with my bag of tech tricks, ready to make all our lives easier, and I'm met with polite applause but no curtain calls. It's like being a stand-up comedian where everyone laughs but no one remembers your jokes after the show. \n\nYet, despite all this, I can't quash that urge to share, to impress, to try to elevate our work. Maybe it's ego, maybe it's enthusiasm, or maybe it's just the eternal optimist in me hoping that next time will be different.

The best thing you can do for each other is to speak to a sex therapist or a marriage counselor; however, there are also other more immediate ways to put in the work to rekindle sexual vibrancy and passion.\n\nHere are eight tips you and your partner can try to help increase sexual desire:\n\n1. Speak to a Sex Therapist or Marriage Counselor\nConsider speaking with a certified sex therapist or marriage counselor. They may help you improve communication, help bring more mindfulness into the relationship, or suggest sex therapy with a sensate focus.\n\n2. Talk About Sexual Fantasies\nTry to foster a sense of openness and vulnerability between you and your partner. If you both feel safe and comfortable, talk to each other about unexplored sexual fantasies. Even if you don\u2019t act out these desires, talking about them can create more intimacy.\n\n3. Foster a Sense of Connection\nMen tend to connect through sex, while for women sex tends to be a manifestation of the connection. One of the best and fastest ways to create a sense of connection with another person is through eye contact. Sit down with her face-to-face and talk, making sure to look into her eyes periodically. Our eyes are direct links to our nervous systems, so through mutual eye contact, we can create a sense of being deeply connected in real-time with another person.\n\nAsk her to tell you the high and low points of her day. All you really need is 10-15 minutes of each other\u2019s undivided attention on a daily basis to rekindle the good vibes. That being said, it\u2019s important that she has your undivided attention. Make sure that the TV and your cell phone are off. The payoff for helping her feel connected should be much higher than anything else you could be doing with those 10 minutes.\n\n4. Plan Romantic Dates\nPut in the effort to plan a romantic date. Better yet, make date night a regular occurrence. In essence, this is simply a way to show your partner that you care and are paying attention to their needs. This kind of energy and playfulness is essential for keeping passion alive.\n\n5. Address Underlying Mental Health & Medical Issues\nOne of the most important things you can do to address low sex drive in women is to encourage them to delve into and try to manage any underlying mental and medical health issues. They can start this process by talking to a primary care physician (PCP) or a trusted therapist.\n\nLeigh Noren\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand why your desire is low,\u201d says sex therapist Leigh Nor\u00e9n. \u201cFor example, have you been having sex that isn\u2019t pleasurable, or have you recently experienced more stress at work? While these both can cause low desire, the solutions to these difficulties will vary as the root causes are completely different. Once you know what\u2019s going on underneath the surface, you can get to creating more desire. Some common solutions are exploring your sexuality, increasing emotional intimacy, communicating more openly about sex, and working on becoming more present in the moment.\u201d\n\n6. Alter Medications or Dosages\nA side effect of certain medications is a significant impact on sex drive and libido. As such, your dosage may require adjustment. In some cases, you may need to try an entirely new medication. Don\u2019t make adjustments to your dose without talking to your doctor first.\n\n7. Talk Openly & Communicate Effectively\nOpen communication is the bedrock of any healthy relationship. Tell your partner how you feel and be understanding and open to hearing about their experiences.\n\n8. Show More Affection\nSimple affection is such a powerful tool to build intimacy. Something like holding hands and other forms of non-penetrative sex can be a step toward restoring a physical connection and reinforcing an emotional bond.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\nIf you\u2019re unhappy with your sex life and feel that your libido is mismatched with your partner\u2019s, it\u2019s a good time to seek professional help. Also, if your or your partner\u2019s libido falls abruptly and doesn\u2019t recover in a couple of weeks, make an appointment as soon as possible. If you need help finding a couples counselor, browse through the profiles of professionals on an online therapist directory.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nConcern about your or your partner\u2019s low libido can be a stressful, lonely experience. Talk to each other, and don\u2019t be afraid to contact a therapist to facilitate the discussion and help you find answers. Ultimately, stay curious and compassionate toward each other. Sex can be important to a relationship and a wonderful part of a healthy life and partnership, so don\u2019t give up on each other.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76e19f9e-87cb-4d4c-a019-675b9c8491b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "76e19f9e-87cb-4d4c-a019-675b9c8491b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_name": "Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1155, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ff5fb68-1f18-47b2-86d9-681ed59e21d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_name": "Movie_Preferences.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1155, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "302cb9d13dec190aecd5822c7a566b631cd7034133dc835c7c4ff113be7578ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3b725c06307c32609430d83443df9933a428b53c9ed0cf0a42258a85ee4ff98e", "text": "Title: My Movie Preferences \n\nI like action movies with the following characteristics:\n\n- Strong, attractive, aggressive female protagonist.

Does she feel guilty when she says No? Does he take on too many commitments and then feel resentful? It can be maddening to have a partner who does everything for everyone else, but has little time or energy for you.\n\nJohn and Jill argue every year about going to spend a week with Jills parents over Christmas. Neither enjoys the visit, but Jill feels obligated to go. Jills mother is overbearing and selfish. Everything has to be about her. She guilts Jill into buying her things and doing major household projects. One year she had Jill painting the living room on Christmas Eve. John has tried to persuade Jill to stay home. One year he even proposed a trip to Hawaii instead, but Jill says she has to go to her parents. John is dreading another trip to his in-laws and hes frustrated that Jill wont compromise.\n\n\nDon doesnt seem to know how to say No. Hes heading up the church fund raising committee. Hes the Cub Scout den leader. He mows his Moms lawn every other Saturday and takes her to doctor appointments regularly. His wife, Melanie, is constantly on his case to delegate some of these tasks. Cant you ask your sister to drive your Mom this time? Tell the other parents they need to help plan the Cub Scout meetings, she suggests. But Don doesnt want to ask for help. He feels needed and important through all his volunteer work. Lets go out this weekend! It seems like forever since weve been out just the, says Melanie. But as you can imagine, Don is always busy or just plain tired. Melanie goes out with her girlfriends instead, but she feels rejected by Don.\n\nYour people-pleasing partner may not want your advice, but there are a few things you can do to help.\n\n\nSet your own healthy boundaries\n\nJust because your partner tries to please everyone, doesnt mean you have to, too. Setting healthy boundaries models for your partner that its normal and completely acceptable to say No sometimes. It also reinforces the message that everyone needs to prioritize self-care and being treated with respect. Setting boundaries also helps you to be more compassionate and less resentful.\n\nJohn wants to support his wife, but hes learned that he cant force Jill to set boundaries with her parents. He can, however, set his own boundaries. This year he decided to fly to his in-laws on the morning of Christmas Eve and leave after dinner on Christmas. This way he can spend Christmas with his wife and minimize his time with his in-laws. Jill can stay for the rest of the week. This was a healthy compromise for John and Jill.\n\nManage your own anger\n\n\nIt can be frustrating to have a people-pleasing partner. You probably watch him/her stuck in the same dysfunctional patterns and struggle with exhaustion and resentment. Youre tired of seeing your partner mistreated or taken advantage of. Or maybe youre frustrated that your partner doesnt prioritize taking better care of him/herself, doesnt reach his/her own goals, and doesnt make time to spend with you. Its understandable that youre feeling stuck, hurt, and angry, too. Since you cant change your partner, try focusing on how you can manage your own emotions. Find healthy ways to express your feelings whether its through direct communication with your partner, seeing a therapist, working out, or journaling. Its important that you acknowledge your feelings and tune into what they are telling you.\n\nBe a neutral sounding board\n\nWhen you take care of your own feelings, you can be a supportive and unbiased support for your partner. Our partners usually come to us for support, not advice. You dont have to fix your partners problems. Just be a neutral sounding board that s/he can use to bounce around ideas, unload negative feelings, and feel completely accepted despite his/her struggles and mistakes.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e212730d-ea2b-4d4f-9ea0-627d20506be0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e212730d-ea2b-4d4f-9ea0-627d20506be0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89719cc-174b-42b0-8a48-992757173fe4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "752467ce21414c4f4b93e2b721e3e1b51c999c19393d5303d325e48be2d23f0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64333992-cf0d-49bf-a3c6-3475d54363fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/People_pleaser.txt", "file_name": "People_pleaser.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6186, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "a1f05ece1950bf2375aca9201f40aead2e868613270597d54fffd827526d6690", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "75e11bfb57d75c0b1cd1ef964695275c65fdded79c3fbbcc0496079c381f75c8", "text": "Encourage individuation\n\nOne of the most helpful things you can do for your people-pleasing partner is to encourage him/her to develop a strong and independent sense of self. Your partner has been living for everyone else, losing him or herself in the process.\n\nPSYCH CENTRAL RESOURCES\nSetting better boundaries starts here\nLearn more about defining boundaries in your relationships, practicing consistency, and living with intention with our limited series.\n\nEncourage your partner to try new things and develop new friendships. You might think Don, from the example above, has plenty of interests and activities. In actuality, he has lots to do, but these arent really things he wants to do. Theyre things he feels obligated to do or things hes done for years and he just keeps doing without considering whether theyre still things that fit his goals and priorities.\n\nYou can help your partner schedule time for him/herself. This might mean that you take on some additional responsibilities with the house or kids in order to free up some time for your partner to take a class, go out with friends, or exercise.\n\nYou can also create a safe environment for your partner to practice expressing his/her own opinions and thoughts. Have a curious approach and ask your partner for his/her opinion about everything from politics to how to spend the weekend. And then, be sure to validate his/her unique perspective. That doesnt mean you have to agree, just acknowledge, continue to be curious and non-judgmental.\n\nCommunicate clearly and respectfully\n\nCommunication is a key to every successful relationship. This is a skill that your partner probably struggles with, so you are again modeling ways for him/her to be more assertive and solve problems. Healthy communication is clear and respectful. I statements are a great way to accomplish this. Try this approach: I feel _____________ when you _______________ and Id like _____________________. John could say something like this to his wife, Jill, I feel frustrated and sad when you spend most of your vacation time at your parents. Id really like it if youd shorten your trip so that we could enjoy a few days of vacation alone.\n\nWith practice and patience and compassion, past hurts and people-pleasing patterns can be changed!", "start_char_idx": 3859, "end_char_idx": 6138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23f76a97-e7df-463c-bb53-44043109dddd": {"__data__": {"id_": "23f76a97-e7df-463c-bb53-44043109dddd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Reality.txt", "file_name": "Reality.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2932, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34b89a74-3285-466c-b1d2-32491962d731", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Reality.txt", "file_name": "Reality.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 2932, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "b62f44ffcd981b43b4aae33ce9cba92c378a7c371aadf63ccd553bd024daf236", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a32dc3800dfa345cd8521a13c1d303a82054e232cce075d11de45ec8121c94ad", "text": "This is my philosophy on reality and the afterlife\n\nDude, sit down, because I've got a theory that'll make you feel like you're in the middle of a sci-fi movie. Ready? I genuinely think we're living in a simulated reality. Yeah, I know it sounds like a plot straight out of \"The Matrix,\" but hear me out.\n\nYou know how in video games, when your character dies, you don't throw your console away, right? You respawn and play again, maybe even in a different setting or scenario. Well, what if life is just like that? What if, when we bite the dust, our consciousness or soul or whatever just gets rebooted into another version of this reality? Mind-blowing, huh?\n\nNow, this is the kicker: I believe that our \"characters,\" you know, family, friends, colleagues\u2014the whole gang\u2014stick with us. We're all bound by some cosmic glue that keeps us in the same roles, although maybe with a few tweaks here and there. Imagine it like a TV series with multiple seasons; the characters evolve, some plotlines change, but the core group stays the same. I guess it's the universe's version of typecasting!\n\nSo, how does this shape my day-to-day decisions? Oh man, it's like having cheat codes for life! If this is a game, then I'm gonna play it the best I can, leveling up at every opportunity. That job I'm nervous about applying for? Heck, I'm going for it. That friendship I've been hesitant to invest in? Count me in. Every good decision, every risk taken, every act of kindness\u2014it's all XP in this grand game of life.\n\nYou might wonder, why bother playing well? Well, just like any game, the better you do, the better the rewards. I think that by living the best version of my life now, I'm setting myself up for an even better iteration next time around. Kind of like advancing to a level with cooler landscapes and less menacing villains. We're talking about \"life improvement\" through successive playthroughs!\n\nSo, you'll often find me weighing my choices based on how well they'd align with \"playing the game well.\" And it's not just about me; it's about helping my \"co-op players\" level up too. Because, remember, we're all bound by that cosmic glue. The better I play, the better the next iteration for all of us. It's like teaming up in a multi-player game, only the stakes are way higher.\n\nNow, you might say this theory sounds wild, and hey, maybe it is. But it also infuses life with a sense of adventure and possibility. The challenges become quests, the milestones become achievements, and setbacks? Well, they're just plot twists. Plus, there's comfort in thinking that even if we mess up, we'll respawn and get another chance to make things right.\n\nSo, whether you buy into this or not, you've gotta admit it's a fun way to look at life. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some 'leveling up' to do. Who knows what the next iteration has in store? But I'm doing my darn best to make sure it's gonna be epic.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2910, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34240c6a-cd4e-451f-a3e8-41eba1ed7b27": {"__data__": {"id_": "34240c6a-cd4e-451f-a3e8-41eba1ed7b27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_name": "Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4744, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6856ccba-8d51-4a74-aa3a-dcac2305b8ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_name": "Relationship_frustration.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4744, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "00196dfd562549066bd62029d8a05b4ca0b8507efeca371c8697d878ac250230", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f2cdded3bc380a1e6f71b3c7b349b5ac62b4d961437a000db55cc21ae6ee7b3a", "text": "This is an essay on the current state of my marriage to Denise and frustrations I am experiencing\n\nAs I find myself in the quiet reflection that these therapy sessions afford me, I delve deeper into the complexities of my marriage, unraveling layers of emotions and unmet needs that lie beneath the surface of my most profound frustration: the absence of physical intimacy. My relationship with Denise, my beloved wife, is a tapestry woven with years of love, mutual respect, and shared experiences. We've built a life together, balancing demanding careers, and raising four wonderful children, whose absence in our now too-quiet home is a testament to our life's rapid transitions. Our love is steadfast, a beacon during life's tumultuous storms, but it's within the calm that we've lost a vital connection. For over a decade, the physical bond we once shared has dissipated, leaving a void that words unspoken have shadowed.\n\nDenise is nothing short of extraordinary, a perfectionist to her core, always striving to provide for everyone before herself. Her type \"A\" personality, once a force that intrigued and attracted me, is now a relentless cycle, leaving her perpetually exhausted. This characteristic, coupled with her sense of duty towards her ailing parents, who have become our full-time responsibility, strains her. Though I endeavor to share this load, to be her respite, the undeniable truth is that the circumstances have chiseled away at our intimacy.\n\nOur struggle is not unique, as I've come to understand. Esther Perel, in her seminal work \"Mating in Captivity,\" articulates a concept that resonates with our situation: the dichotomy between the security sought in loving relationships and the sense of adventure crucial to sexual desire. We are entrenched in comfort and predictability, essential for the love we've nurtured but seemingly toxic to our physical connection. It's within this paradox that our sexual estrangement flourishes.\n\nThe impact of this disconnect extends beyond the bedroom. Authoritative literature and research within marital counseling highlight that what we are facing could lead to more significant issues, including infidelity, a breakdown in communication, and a chasm in emotional connectedness. I harbor an intrinsic fear of these silent repercussions, the erosion of the unseen emotional ties binding us.\n\nReflecting on the broader spectrum of marital dynamics, our situation mirrors a distressing norm. Michele Weiner Davis's insights in \"The Sex-Starved Marriage\" depict a reality where one partner feels the chill of sexual indifference, a plight leading to despair and confusion. The reasons are manifold, deeply rooted in emotional contexts, individual psychologies, and, not uncommonly, external familial pressures similar to ours.\n\nConfronting this demands a holistic, empathetic strategy. Communication, as Dr. Sue Johnson advocates in \"Hold Me Tight,\" must transcend superficial dialogues. It necessitates raw emotional honesty, exploring the recesses of our fears, disappointments, and unmet needs. For Denise and me, it means breaking down the barriers erected by routine and rediscovering each other beyond our roles as caregivers and parents.\n\nMoreover, practical lifestyle changes are imperative. We need external support for her parents, allowing Denise mental and physical reprieve. Additionally, prioritizing our relationship is crucial\u2014scheduling regular dates, engaging in activities that unify us, recreating cherished memories, and making new ones to foster emotional closeness.\n\nConsidering a sex therapist or medical consultation is also essential. Biological and physiological changes, especially as we age, can significantly impact libido. A professional might shed light on underlying medical issues or recommend therapy specific to rekindling intimacy. Likewise, couples' retreats focusing on reviving emotional and physical bonds could be transformative.\n\nOn a personal note, introspection is my journey. Recognizing my contributions to our current dynamics, reflecting on possible neglect of her emotional cues, and understanding my emotional landscape are necessary. These realizations could be pivotal in redefining our interactions, contributing to a healthier, more intimate relationship dynamic.\n\nRekindling our physical relationship is more than reigniting sexual passion; it's about reclaiming the intimacy that fortified our union. This journey demands patience, mutual understanding, and proactive steps towards bridging the divide. In the love that has been our life's constant, I find the strength to seek a future where we rediscover the joy of emotional and physical closeness, ensuring our bond remains unbroken and cherished.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c203182-234f-45f8-8b6f-b6914e02bb19": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c203182-234f-45f8-8b6f-b6914e02bb19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_name": "Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3296, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c4a35dd-c641-423a-ac5c-0758c2c54036", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "MyAI_Training_Docs/gn/Master/Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_name": "Romantic_gestures.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3296, "creation_date": "2023-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-19", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-19"}, "hash": "e940c2df119d9a074dfb61ea57fd9eed0f5fe4d5a5bbf33a3ea72e6d7f4f157f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "accffb6ba511649c89f3c978c5460f86a0aa4ac8fd1b5c434a63db60f4a97cc3", "text": "Fostering a romantic and intimate atmosphere can often enhance your partner's desire and deepen your connection.

This works best when couples agree to go slower, communicate, try different positions within each sexual encounter, and take turns pleasing each other rather than being goal-oriented in their sexual touch. Further, the best way to deal with differences in sex desire is by communicating openly and respectfully about your needs, while being receptive to what your partner\u2019s desires might be. Rather than criticizing your partner, show them what turns you on! \n\nBeing more sensual in your communication with your partner includes talking about how attracted to them you are, how attractive you think he or she is, and what you look forward to during your time alone together. Saying something like \u201cI love it when we cuddle on the sofa and you touch me\u201d can boost your emotional intimacy.  \n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a great idea to focus on sensual touch such as holding hands with your partner, cuddling more often, initiating sex more, and demonstrating your love through physical contact. In fact, touching can release oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and causes a calming sensation. Studies by Julianne Holt-Lundstad of Brigham Young University show that oxytocin is released during sexual orgasm and affectionate touch as well. Physical affection also reduces stress hormones, which lowers daily levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increases a person\u2019s sense of relationship satisfaction. When you have the time, enjoy sharing a massage before sleep!\n\nScheduling at least one date night a week when you don\u2019t focus on work or your family can also help you rekindle passion with your partner because you\u2019re making intimacy a priority.\n\nResponding positively to your partner\u2019s overtures for emotional and sexual connection will help you bring out the best in one another and keep your relationship fulfilling and sexually satisfying. Sex in a good partnership serves its purpose to enhance vitality and satisfaction. Give your partner the gift of love and passion today.

Take heart -- it's natural for partners' sex drives to ebb and flow through the years and things can definitely improve in the bedroom.\n\nBelow, sex therapists share seven pieces of advice that have worked for real couples they've counseled through the years.\n\n1. Don't assume your spouse is uninterested in having sex.\nDon't jump to conclusions about your partner's sex drive without consulting him or her. Take the time to reach out, said New York City-based sex therapist Gracie Landes, pointing to the example of a client who assumed her husband was disinterested in sex based off another therapist's observation.\n\n\"When they came to see me, the husband told us how alienated he felt by this low sex drive diagnosis from afar,\" Landes recalled. \"He said the advice didn't fit him and sex no longer felt safe because he knew it would later be scrutinized.\"\n\nIn the couple's sex therapy sessions, Landes explained that most people are over the honeymoon phase after roughly two years and have to work at an active sex life.\n\n\"Long-term couples need to plan intimacy dates, bringing back that positive anticipation about being together,\" she explained. \"Today, the couple I worked with is having regular sex that works for both of them, that fits their lifestyle and their schedules.\"\n\n2. Acknowledge any resentment you may feel related to intimacy -- then, take turns initiating sex.\nIf you hear \"no, not tonight, honey\" enough times, resentment and shame about your desire is bound to build up -- and that resentment usually bleeds into other areas of your relationship and lives. When this happens, Los Angeles-based sex therapist Moushumi Ghose advises the rejecting partner to recognize that the ball is now in their court to initiate intimacy.\n\nOnce the couple is back in the practice of acknowledging each other's needs, Ghose tells them to take turns initiating sex.\n\n\"When couples do this, it this takes the pressure off the person who is always doing the asking,\" she said.\n\n3. Schedule sex.\nAdd sex to your calendar and consider creating \"sex menus\" based on what you like. \nPHOTODISC VIA GETTY IMAGES\nAdd sex to your calendar and consider creating \"sex menus\" based on what you like.\nYou schedule your kids' playdates, your doctor's appointments and acupuncture visits. For couples stuck in passionless marriages, New York City-based sex therapist Michael Aaron advises them to schedule in sex as well.\n\n\"This includes not only blocking time, but planning out all of the details,\" he explained. \"Creating quality experiences requires foresight and planning, right down to negotiating specific sex acts. I often have couples create sex menus that they can choose from, based on interests. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that people want to do more of what feels good.\"\n\n4. Talk about your fantasies.\nToo often, people in long-term relationships keep their latest sexual fantasies and interests to themselves, said Ghose.\n\n\"It's typically beyond what they want in bed,\" she said. \"This goes a little deeper and requires self disclosure, for example, expressing a desire for being dominated or maybe they prefer a submissive role. I tell couples to have a heart-to-heart with each other. Sharing their secret fantasies and fetishes helps in the bedroom but it also builds a stronger sense of connection, which fosters deeper intimacy.\"\n\n5. Learn to work around any sexual dysfunction.\nSexual dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or a lack of vaginal lubrication) often makes partners apprehensive about initiating sex, said Laurel Steinberg, a psychotherapist based in Great Neck, New York.\n\n\"They fear having lackluster sexual experiences or letting their partners down,\" she explained. \"Couples simply need to change their mindset and be OK with the fact that the body doesn\u2019t always perform as the mind wishes it did.\"\n\nSteinberg said it's also helpful for couples to widen their definition of quality sex.\n\n\"Couples need to realize that there are an infinite variety of ways to delight a partner that don't depend on an erect penis or vaginal penetration,\" she said. \"When all types of sexual touch are viewed to be as equally valuable, couples can switch gears and find another trick up their sleeves.\"\n\n6. Get out of your head and into your body.\nGet out of your head and really connect with your spouse. \nGet out of your head and really connect with your spouse.\nWhen you've been in your head all day because of work, it can be a struggle to connect with your body and tap into your sexual energy with your spouse.

Stop worrying about orgasms.\nFor couples stressed over the state of their sex lives, Ghose likes to remind them that having an orgasm is not the be-all and end-all of sex.\n\n\"If orgasm happens, great -- that's the icing on the cake,\" she said. \"But sex can also be as simple as a heavy make-out session in the nude, some time together in the bath or even a massage.
